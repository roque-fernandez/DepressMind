Like he seems to have done with Serelis as a HC. \nI\u2019d say they also gotta keep Lee. He has been a defensive menace in the Mon-Oly play off series from last season. He can make some buckets with some open threes and his floaters. But definitely not a starting 5 PG. Given that Pana is rumoured to sign Vildoza, Facu or both he is an important asset.\nBig papa is gonna leave Ig so no point talking about the guy. \nOf course they gotta utilise the young talented players they got parked on the bench. Especially Mantzoukas. \nThe rest of the roster is replaceable imo.",

Generally, I\u2019m the most patient guy in the whole world. This girl though was testing me. After 4 years she didn\u2019t want to show affection cause suddenly she didn\u2019t trust me. Every woman that was an acquitance, a friend, a coworker was there to get me. I didn\u2019t make friends with women cause I didn\u2019t want to set her off. I didn\u2019t make comments about anyone cause she\u2019d be set off. \nOn the night of our break up, after she broke up with me cause she can\u2019t trust me anymore, we got so drunk. I put her in my bed until she is sober so she can go her way in the morning. She said something to me that set me off, and before I left my house to go and sleep in my office, I told her \u201cIt\u2019s my fault I wasted four years of my life with you. Go back to your shitty cocaine addiction, and you can just OD and drop dead for all I care.\u201d \nI still regret those words, and I have apologised for these words over and over again.

 "text": "Girl wants me to take her virginity I need advice Look man. I took some girl\u2019s virginity twice so far. First was my first time as well so technically it doesn\u2019t count. But the second was when I had experience and I dated that girl for a year.\nFirst times are hard for them. If you wanna do it you must be caring and you must care for her. I\u2019d ask often if everything is okay or if she is hurting by something I do. Start small and for the love of god don\u2019t go jackhammering\u2026 When a girl loses her virginity with you she must be comfortable. You cannot just hook up with her. The most decent thing you can do is turn that experience into something she\u2019ll remember fondly later.\nThat being said, if you\u2019re only planning to hook up with her, don\u2019t do it. I doubt you can think of her comfort in that degree when you have no emotional attachment to her\u2026",
