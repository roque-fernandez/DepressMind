That\u2019s not the problem, because of my depression I\u2019ve never felt I can tell someone my problems because I don\u2019t want to pull them under my dark cloud, which I feel everyone can see. So I just internalized my anger at this dude for 2 days and now it just came out. I came out the shower so angry thinking about how I didn\u2019t say shit to this guy and that it\u2019s my parents fault I can\u2019t stand up for myself, that I was literally muttering curse words under my breath like a homeless psycho. I pass my mom in the hallway and she asks how I am ( it\u2019s just me and my mom in a small house, my dad cheated on her so she got the house in the divorce), I say \u201cgreat\u201d in a mean tone. I get in my room and start kicking my bed and just basically yeah obscenities and nasty mean things. My mom and I have been having problems, so she thinks im saying this about her, and they partly were geared towards because I know I can be a asshole to her and she kinda just has to deal with it. She come screaming in my room, like loud and angry, and I just stand there thinking these horrible thoughts about her, she leave then I kick the door hard right after she shuts it, come in screaming louder and angrier saying I have to be out in 30 days. And now I\u2019m here typing about it. If I wasn\u2019t such a depressed loser and said something to this Italian boy I don\u2019t think I would be taking it out on my mom. But I hate that I\u2019ve become this person, I hate myself so much for hurting my mom and my dad and letting other people hurt me. I want to be different, I don\u2019t want to die but I see no purpose to trying to be better, I truly believe I\u2019ll just be this depressed loser who let\u2019s people walk over him and then takes his anger out on the wrong people. What type of life is that? I feel like death is my only option. Anyways it\u2019s nice to put this somewhere, I definitely can\u2019t tell my friends about this.",

Having everything on pause, had me feeling pointless as well and idle waiting for the world to return to normal. Now I\u2019m still just as depressed, but full fledged addiction has taken over. I get no pleasure out of anything other than chasing the high. I wish it weren\u2019t like this, I \u201cwish I could just stop\u201d like everyone suggests.",

I considered going back to that program but realized a year later I still have their cookie cutter CBT/DBT curriculums basically memorized and have since started teaching my online friends how to do progressive muscle relaxation, paced breathing, mindfulness, what values are, stuff like that. Anyway I wish I had a more concrete plan for what I\u2019m doing next but for now it\u2019s just therapy every week as usual and trying to keep myself alive. Whoopie.\nOh, and now I\u2019m having cardiac issues and god only knows why. It might be because of medications I tried recently on top of the medications I\u2019ve been taking since I was a kid\u2026feels like I\u2019ve been punished for trying to feel better. Funny part is that the concept of having a heart attack or a stroke (obviously this is my anxiety thinking up the worst case scenario) and dying is actually terrifying and I desperately do not want this. How very ironic and annoying. Further proof that depression is bullshit and the void in my brain is more of an emo teenager than an the supervillain it makes itself out to be.\nThat should feel comforting but it actually makes me feel week. Like a grown adult getting beat up by a teenager. And to further add onto the irony is that one of the reasons I quit my job at the high school was because I was intimidated by the teenagers. Good lord lol. If god was real he certainly would have had a great and sadistic sense of humor.",
