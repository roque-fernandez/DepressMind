I'd like to buy  a used EV, looking at the Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf primarily. Leaning towards the Bolt because it has much better range.\nMy questions are around how to evaluate used cars. I see a lot of 2018-2019 Leafs or Bolts in my price range with low mileage, but not sure what makes a good option/deal for that age. What would be definite things to avoid?  \nLocation: DC area\nPrice range: Would prefer to stay under $25,000, closer to or under $20,000 would be more comfortable but $25,000 is still doable, just not a much money for fun stuff.\nLease or Buy: Buy (unless there is some advantage to leasing in this situation)\nNew or used: Used\nType of vehicle: Sedan or Crossover \nMust haves: Electric \nDesired transmission (auto/manual, etc): Automatic\nIntended use: Daily commute - I drive a triangle from home to work to daycare to back home that's about 25 miles total. Once every few months I may drive a few hours up or down i95 for weekend trips.\nVehicles you've already considered: Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt\nIs this your 1st vehicle: No\nDo you need a Warranty: I don't know?\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc): No\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt/chains, body work, suspension etc ) No\nAdditional Notes:",

 "text": "Check maintenance records, check tires (not a good sign if they're bald and/or cheap chinese junk), look for leaks, test drive and pay attention to abnormal vibrations/noises, along with alignment (take your hands off on a flat road and see if it tracks straight). Push every button in the car to check functionality. You can also get a pre purchase inspection but I don't they're worth the effort or cost for newer/lower mileage cars (obvious exception for high end stuff). \nI think the main worry buying a used EV is having bad cells in the battery pack. It's possible a scan tool could tell you that but you'd need to research that for the particular models you're looking at. That may or may not be covered under warranty still",

There are really no unreliable or bad years of the MX-5, so if buying used will save you money and you find one in good shape, it's a good option. Take a look at the changes made to different years in your market. In the US, 2019 was when they refreshed the MX-5 and gave the 2.0L engine more power and added a backup camera and a telescopic steering wheel. In 2020, they added standard active safety features, and in 2021, they made Android Auto and Apple CarPlay standard in all trim levels.",
