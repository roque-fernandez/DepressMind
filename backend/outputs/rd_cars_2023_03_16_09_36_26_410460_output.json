I'd like to buy  a used EV, looking at the Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf primarily. Leaning towards the Bolt because it has much better range.\nMy questions are around how to evaluate used cars. I see a lot of 2018-2019 Leafs or Bolts in my price range with low mileage, but not sure what makes a good option/deal for that age. What would be definite things to avoid?  \nLocation: DC area\nPrice range: Would prefer to stay under $25,000, closer to or under $20,000 would be more comfortable but $25,000 is still doable, just not a much money for fun stuff.\nLease or Buy: Buy (unless there is some advantage to leasing in this situation)\nNew or used: Used\nType of vehicle: Sedan or Crossover \nMust haves: Electric \nDesired transmission (auto/manual, etc): Automatic\nIntended use: Daily commute - I drive a triangle from home to work to daycare to back home that's about 25 miles total. Once every few months I may drive a few hours up or down i95 for weekend trips.\nVehicles you've already considered: Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt\nIs this your 1st vehicle: No\nDo you need a Warranty: I don't know?\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc): No\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt/chains, body work, suspension etc ) No\nAdditional Notes:",

 "text": "Check maintenance records, check tires (not a good sign if they're bald and/or cheap chinese junk), look for leaks, test drive and pay attention to abnormal vibrations/noises, along with alignment (take your hands off on a flat road and see if it tracks straight). Push every button in the car to check functionality. You can also get a pre purchase inspection but I don't they're worth the effort or cost for newer/lower mileage cars (obvious exception for high end stuff). \nI think the main worry buying a used EV is having bad cells in the battery pack. It's possible a scan tool could tell you that but you'd need to research that for the particular models you're looking at. That may or may not be covered under warranty still",

There are really no unreliable or bad years of the MX-5, so if buying used will save you money and you find one in good shape, it's a good option. Take a look at the changes made to different years in your market. In the US, 2019 was when they refreshed the MX-5 and gave the 2.0L engine more power and added a backup camera and a telescopic steering wheel. In 2020, they added standard active safety features, and in 2021, they made Android Auto and Apple CarPlay standard in all trim levels.",

OTD price makes a bigger difference than fuel cost.For example, if you pay 4k less for fuel but 8k more to buy the hybrid in the first place you paiod 4k MORE overall.\nHybrids are overhpyped and overpriced (OTD is all that matters, ignore MSRP).\nExplorer is a bad model, one of the worst in the segment. Poor quality. Sells based on branding and to fleets.

 "text": "The classic enthusiast conundrum, huh? I guess we can start by breaking it down by your list of factors:. I'm also gonna add the Hyundai Elantra N to the mix -- it's definitely worth considering.\n\nToyota and Honda are probably the reliability winners here, but even between those, the Civic Si is probably the best bet. The GR Corolla has some fairly new parts that aren't exactly tried and true yet. The WRX has had an issue or two with the new generation, and WRX models have never been the most reliable long term. Volkswagen has its usual issues. \nThe Type R is just a blast to drive, but setting it aside for its price tag, I'd say the GR Corolla is probably the next best, then the Elantra N and WRX, then the GTI and the Si. That's just my off-the-cuff fun-factor ranking, so to each their own. But they are sort of \"tiered\" when it comes to power, chassis, suspension, and how they try to balance fun, comfort, and price.\nHonda is reeeeally good at packaging, space, and ergonomics. The Type R would be the winner for cargo space, and even the Si does well with back seat room and flexibility as a sedan. Fold down the back seats and you get a surprising amount of space still. The GTI is pretty huge with the back seats down. The WRX and Elantra N are average. The GR Corolla's space and flexibility are a bit compromised.\nHonda makes the best affordable manual transmissions right now. While the Civic Si has some minor timing issues when you push it hard, it doesn't change the fact that it's a joy to shift. The others are all pretty great too.\nThe GR Corolla and WRX are the AWD options here, and that's pretty cool, but unless you have some off-pavement rallying in your future, or you reeeeally prefer AWD in the winter, I wouldn't put as much stock into AWD vs FWD if I were you. Winter tires will do the trick when it's cold. But it'll be up to you how much to weigh this category.\nAdding a category, comfort for most of these is a mixed bag, but I'll point out that the Type R and Civic Si are both really good with comfort and ergonomics, and the GTI also does a great job there. The Elantra N isn't fancy but is comfy and well done, as long as the suspension is in its comfiest setting. The GR Corolla is good but not the smoothest Corolla out there. I'd need another drive in the WRX to see how ride quality and comfort compare to previous generations, which weren't the best.\n\nMy personal opinion? I'd go GR Corolla, if I found a Core model with the Performance package and it was comfy and useful enough for me. Next choice would be Elantra N, if I was happy with the interior space and comfort and if FWD wasn't a deal breaker. Third would probably be the Civic Si, unless the GTI really spoke to me. Maybe the current WRX just isn't my thing, who knows. Don't listen to my two-bit opinion, but hopefully the analysis can help you somewhat.",

 "text": "Hatchbacks are deceiving. I like them a lot, but with the back seats up, there can be less usable space than a trunk sometimes, and with the seats folded down, some vehicles offer more usable space than others. The Corolla hatch is good on space, but not the best, and the GR Corolla had to adjust some things for its performance upgrades, like I believe they moved the battery to the back near the trunk, cutting into its space a bit. It's not an uncomfortable car, but make sure the next time you check it out, really look at the space, fold up and down the back seats, sit in them, check out head and leg room, etc. Our experiences may vary too.\nThe GR Corolla sounds MUCH better than the Civic Si. The Honda 1.5T is a great engine in many ways, but it doesn't have a ton of character if I'm being honest, and Honda opted to keep the exhaust pretty muted on top of that. Toyota let the Corolla's turbo 3-cyl sing out a lot more, and they're not even piping it into the cabin digitally. Big win for Toyota there, and it contributes to the better driving experience of the GR.\nWhen it comes down to it, the Civic Si is still a great car, but in this matchup it only wins in the practical categories: Price, comfort, ergonomics, fuel economy, etc. So the question is one of fun vs practicality, really. Test drive both and sleep on it!",

 "text": "All three of the cars you mentioned are great in their own ways. The RS5 is very quick, but doesn't feel as fun or engaging as some of its peers, instead opting for fast luxury and comfort. The S7 is luxurious, spacious, practical, and still very quick, but it was a bit cooler back when it had a V8. The M550i still does have a V8, which is awesome, and it's comfortable and well designed, but it's maybe not quite the most fun or the most luxurious of its peers.\nBut any of them are great. Others worth considering:\n\nAlfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. It's stunning to drive, feels engaging and visceral, looks great, and has some Italian flair on the interior. Its biggest issue is reliability, so it may be in the shop more than the others, but if you're leasing it, you won't have to pay for the repairs.\nMercedes-AMG E53. If you want something in the size of the S7 or M550i that truly balances fun and luxury, this to me strikes the best balance. It's like if the M550i looked better inside and out and was more fun to drive, but had a twin-charged straight-6 instead of a turbocharged V8. It's just about as quick, though!\nGenesis G80. This might not be the best fit for you, but it's such a great deal and so well done, I have to mention it. The top-trim 3.5T Sport Prestige model comes with a twin-turbo V6, a well-done chassis and nice driving experience, all the features, and an interior space truly rivaling the BMW 5-series and its competitors, all for $72k. They may offer some great lease deals as well.",

So the car can't be super spartan for the kids.\nVehicles we've considered: Ford Transit Connect, Chevy Tahoe/GMC Yukon, GMC Savannah, Ford F-150, Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon, Toyota Sienna\nIs this their first vehicle?: He currently uses a Ford Aerostar, he'd keep it but rust is getting the best of it.\nDo you need a warranty: Strongly Preferred\nCan you do Minor Work on your vehicle: Yes\nCan you do major work on your vehicle: Probably not, he has to park on the street.\n\u200b\nHe would just get the box van but he is worried hes gonna look like a predator picking up his kids from school.",

I live in a city, but I do often drive on gravel to sometimes dirt to sometimes difficult roads\nVehicles you've already considered: 4-door Bronco, 4Runner, Outback, smallest I could go is either CRV or RAV4; I have looked at Mazda, Volvos, but I am concerned about off-road ability. I drive an early '00s Highlander that is lifted and has off-roading tires, roof-box, bike racks. I need to be able to parallel park in the city, so I don't need something insanely large, but we do have multiple dogs, hike and camp a bit. I don't drive every day in the city (we also own a very small old beat up sedan for city). During the winter, we use the SUV more when the roads are dodgy.\nIs this your 1st vehicle: No.\nDo you need a Warranty: No\nCan you do Minor work on your own vehicle: (fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) No\nCan you do Major work on your own vehicle: (engine and transmission, timing belt/chains, body work, suspension etc ) No\nAdditional Notes: It's not like I am going nuts off-roading and take it that seriously; I just need to have the capability to deal with less than great roads areas, which are often off-road, to get to different trail heads, parks. We also do a lot of road trips, and when we do them we often do push the car a bit off-road, but it's not crazy. The Highlander was really great, but the newer models if the Highlander and the CRV seem less off-road capable and more lux. On any given weekend, I may drive 2-3 hours on highway and then 30-45 minutes on dirt or gravel, not that well kept, to get to different areas.\n\u200b\nThanks for any ideas!

You have full time 4WD with selectable drive modes for snow or more difficult terrain. It's a smaller overall footprint, good for the city. It's Jeep so plenty of accessories like hitch and crossbars. I have the V6 which gets 20mpg average but there is an optional 4cyl with turbo. I also fit an infant in her car seat plus 60lb dog with bags decently comfortably. The interior spacing would be my biggest complaint, it's comfy and feels big but awkwardly laid out and the rear door opening is smaller.",

The higher trims you are really getting close to Acura/Lexus interior at Honda/Toyota pricing. Of course, they won't be as reliable and maintenance free as a Toyota, but if you take care of it, it will last you a long time. \nAs for the Focus ST, just go find one to drive honestly. If you can find specifically the ST3 package with the Recaro seats, it is a huge step up on interior quality. I love the exterior look and photos may not do it justice, but that also just comes down to my personal preference. Along the same lines as the Focus ST you could consider a Volkswagen GTI as well.\nGoing a little bit above your budget of 25k you could check out some Hyundai Veloster N's or Elantra N's both of which would be significantly quicker than any of the cars that I listed. I test drove the Veloster N and it was very comparable to driving experience with the Focus ST but it had some more kick and made lots of pops and bangs from the exhaust.",
