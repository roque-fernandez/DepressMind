 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

It's been half a year since he cut ties with me, and I still love him and miss him. He could care less and is happier with someone else. I guess he was never mine in the first place, he basically admitted to just stringing me along because he was lonely and liked the attention I gave him. That makes me sad because I really thought I meant much more to him, but it was all lies. I really hate it. I'm just a miserable bitch, it's no wonder he left me. He wants to act like nothing happened between us and showed up to where our friends were and I just left. I don't want to be around him when he's happy with someone else. I guess that makes me an awful human. I just feel so unlovable and broken. I'm never good enough. I wish I were dead. And the most fucked up thing is that I feel guilty for taking some of his friends. It's not that I purposely did anything. His wonderful new gf completes him. Haha.",

 "text": "The nights are the worst, in the dark only myself and my thoughts. Without divulging too much information I am a 30 yo man, Large, capable ( or at least I used to be ) Physically fit as you'd expect a 30 year old to be. I have struggled with my vices and my emotions, my mental health and well being for a very, very long time. \nRecently, less than a month ago, my wife left me. The typical reasons I guess. The depression, and anxiety driving a wedge between us, the drinking to suppress the feelings and the sadness, eventually leading to us growing apart and I blame myself entirely. She struggled with making the decision and I more or less pushed her to that point. I am having a hard time not being angry at myself, or talking to myself in some pretty disgusting ways. \nI have never been a fan of counseling, or therapy. I guess I have never been put in touch with a good therapist or had a good experience with any. I bury everything as deep as I can but eventually it all comes to a head and explodes. Never violently, but loudly and abruptly. The night she left me we stayed in the same house and for the first time in our marriage we slept in different rooms, I didn't sleep admittedly but stared at a bottle of bourbon for 6 hours. She went to work the next morning, active duty military so she didn't have a choice. I quit my job, packed my few belongings and drove the 1760 miles back home. \nSince that night I haven't drank a drop, dealing with everything sober has been an experience all its own, but I can't help but feel me slipping into the dark places my mind has always gone. I had planned a suicide in great detail years ago and she came along just mere days before I was planning to do it, hell, I even told her that once. I'm scared...I used to be a mountain of a man and now I can't escape feeling like a pile of rubble. I don't want to be here, I don't want to feel that way. How do I curb it? How do I find the desire in me that I know is there but hiding? I am strong, I am intelligent, I can be all the self affirming things in the world but these characteristics  seem to disappear when the darkness starts looming again. I posted on reddit because it feels safer than a face to face. I need help, I just don't know what help....",

You get fed up with losing all the time, I used to joke that it could be raining 100 dollar bills and I would walk out side and catch a sack of shit. It's naive for me to assume the world is against me though tit feels that way sometimes. You would think statistically one could get a win now and then. Dealing with things like this repeatedly you start to think you are the problem and in most cases that is exactly the truth. I have done a lot of hard things in life, but loving myself, or getting right with my mind is easily the most difficult thing I have ever experienced.",

A while ago I had developed a fairly close friendship with someone who ended up blaming me for their breakup (it ended for reasons entirely unrelated to me) and they said some really awful things.  I didn't really realise this until relatively recently, but that event honestly kind of broke me - I'm sort of realising that in the last year in particular I've felt a lot of cynicism and paranoia towards forming new connections and I think a lot of it stems from that event.  Even if I get past the persistent feeling that someone don't like me, I still feel disposable, like they'll just drop me as a friend and stop talking to me for some reason, or blame me for something.  I've had this happen to me a few times and it's always felt awful but I think the event I mentioned was a bit of a turning point for me because it was someone I thought I had a particularly genuine friendship with.  It's such a rare thing to find, but it can end so easily and in ways you can't even control or predict.  It's so crushing.\nAnyways, there's my midnight rant.  I just feel so completely alone in life and every day feels harder than the last.",

 "text": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to go, but therapy has never really helped me with this problem and I can't bring it up to my mom or grandparents because I'm tired of the endless cycle of me justifiably bringing up an issue and them starting a fight. There's a thousand and one reasons I have depression relating to every poor way my parents \"parented\" me growing up from the neglect of my dad and blatant abuse of my mom and grandfather. But the thing that drove me up a fucking wall today was, my grandmom retired recently and she can't find anything to keep her busy so she just keeps fixing random crap around our house that doesn't need fixing, and bugging the rest of us. I suggested she journal, read, or write a story, she thought it was a good idea, so I went down into our basement guest room where I have a lot of my things stored from college still, to find her a book. And it was re-arranged when my grandparents retired so my grandfather could work on his coin collection. I walk into the room and see my stuff re-arranged. Oh well, as long as it's there neat I'm cool with it. Then I turn around and see the 5 journals I kept through the 3 years of college I had, lined up next to a bunch of old school work and art work my uncle made when he was a kid that my grandmom and mom have been reading and laughing over. So I have this irking and explosive rage building up in me right now that's there because I feel it's pretty obvious that my mom and grandmom have been reading my private shit. It's making me want to explode and yell at them all right now, but I know they'll just try and gas light me and spin on me that I'm the bad guy. I know the easy answer is \"its their house, they can do what they want, move out\", and I've heard it before. But I am trying to move out, it's difficult, and even if I am living here, I bought those journals, and I wrote them when I was living at school, that doesn't give them the right to invade my privacy. And if I haven't mentioned this already the reason I'm so paranoid is because my mom has read my journal without my consent before, during covid, when I was at a really low place with depression working my ass off to pass online physics and chemistry classes that are impossible enough in person and I was going crazy studying extra hours online to pass. And she took everything I wrote out of context, and even though she was barely even mentioned in my journal entries, she decided to take the whole thing personally and cause more problems for me by calling me selfish and starting more fights. I think she's bipolar or borderline personality, because I flipped out at her to never do that again or I'd leave the house and stop talking to her, and she did it again after a few weeks, so I started leaving threats in my journal to hurt her, knowing she'd disobey the one thing I ask of her, hoping she'd stop, but she just started more shit, and then suddenly started leaving weird fake sentimental notes in my journals and always found them no matter where I hid them, as if that would somehow absolve her of the fact she's invading my privacy, insincere apology written in a book your forbidden to write in or not, that's still going against the one thing I ask her not to do, so I followed through and I left mid-way through covid and lived with my dad until move in day the following semester at college, barely speaking to my mom. Then I move back in with her after college and a year goes by, nothing bad except a few arguments, and now we're here, where I see all of my journals removed from where I put them, all neatly stacked in ORDER BY YEAR, making me believe she STILL went against my wishes and read my shit. \nWhat can I do about this until I can move out? I don't want to bring this up to her or my grandparents because I don't want to deal with my mom starting shit and making me feel bad for being born at the moment. And I'm not on good terms with my dad either (long story short he ran off and started a new family with an abusive woman who treated me and my sister like garbage) so I can't just simply up and move there. This is just the tip of the ice berg on how my family has treated me, there is much worse out there that they've done in my life but this is the most recent thing. And I feel really bad saying this but, I've never been a violent person, I've never wanted to hurt anyone nor have I ever attempted to without reasonable cause (self-defense), but I catch myself wishing my family would just all up and die some days, like since I can't get out yet it feels like the only relief I'll get is them all just permanently shutting up. When I finally get to move out I'm just going to cut her off as well as my grandparents and maybe my dad (I say maybe because I still have young half siblings living with him that I would like to be able to know), but for now the only feelings I have for them is dread and the horrifying desire for them to just stop existing. I don't know how to handle this anger, I just know that it's going to eat away at me until something bad happens, like an early life heart attack or something, my blood pressure is already high for my age and it's only gotten higher because of the stress and anger my family causes, I don't know what to do.",

 "text": "So I'm graduating university soon, honours and everything. It's a huge achievement and everyone is congratulating me and telling me I ought to be so proud of myself.  Since I have horrible mental health, it was a real struggle to get through - there were so many sleepless nights, breakdowns and I pushed myself to my absolute limit on many occasions. So reaching the end should be a pretty big victory.\nWhen I started uni, I was basically a recluse who didn't know how to talk to people and had zero social life. However, through a combination of therapy, medication and just how easy uni makes it to socialise, I managed to really come out of my shell. I became the president of a campus social club. Went on a lot of dates. Made some friends. Worked on some really interesting projects. Hell, I even started dressing well. I've been told I'm practically unrecognizable compared to the way I was when I started. It's a real success story. University doesn't necessarily make anything easier, but it makes the opportunities to improve more accessible - want to make friends? Here's a specific event you can go to this week filled with people that have similar interests. It sets you up for success, if you can push yourself to go for it.\nSo after saying all that, you may be wondering what I'm doing here. The problem is, I feel like the only part of my life that's ever mattered is over. These past years have been so eventful and vibrant, and I'm only just realising that now that it's ending. Sort of like how you don't realise when the good old days are until they're over.  What am I even supposed to do with myself now? Nothing will ever be as exciting, and all the social opportunities I enjoyed are going to be much fewer and far between. It might seem silly to be sad about literally achieving my goals, but the university lifestyle is just so dynamic and interesting and I don't want it to end.\nA few people know that I've been struggling with this, but I don't think anybody realises the full extent.  I feel like I've been wearing a mask. A few months from now when I step up onto that stage and accept my degree, it feels like my life will be over.  Like if I ended things right there, that would be fine and I would have ended up a high note. For a while I didn't even want to end things anymore, but now I'm starting to feel that way again.\nI feel worse than I have in ages and it's because I turned myself around and am close to achieving something I've been working towards for a long time. Sounds silly when I say it out loud. But it's how I'm feeling right now.",

I already had to go to the hospital twice for a chest drain which was not a very pleasant experience. I however don't get why because everything went well and everyone was so nice, but I am still terrified. I know I have had it happen more than twice because I have felt the same symptoms multiple times on other occasions, but I am to scared to do anything. But because it happened twice already the chance of it happening again is big and everytime it happens there advice for an operation is stronger, which greatly decreases the chance. This time  I said I said I will wait till next time and get the operation then. I am still scared though, but I also want it to be over so badly. One of the reasons I said no this time is because for a while now I haven't felt great, which stupid enough I am also too scared to say to anyone. But at the moment I am also so scared I will get it again now, which wants to make me get the surgery just to get over with it.",

There are a few things I will try doing before giving up but if they fail to give relief I am actually scared of what will come after that.  Everything is crumbling and rotting away.

 "text": "Sorry in advance for the wall of text, but I can see where you are and I believe my experience will be helpful to you\nThe first, and hardest, step to becoming better is to recognise that you have a problem - which you have done. The thought \"There's probably nothing actually wrong with me\" is the depression speaking. Know that you are self aware enough to see the problem, intelligent enough to know you can't fix everything yourself, and strong enough to seek help. No matter what else the depression has taken from you I can see these 3 things, and more, from your comment alone.\nThe thing about our mind is that absolutely every thing we experience, from hearing a sound to seeing light to watching an action unfold, and everything in between, is simply an interpretation of what's going on around us. The first and most important thing you always have to keep in mind is that YOU ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS. You are the filter that screens and sorts them; your are the junction between \"thought\", \"Memory\", and \"physical action\". You are the observer within your body, whom takes the information available to them and moves their body accordingly. What this means is that what you feel is not you either. You experience the emotion, yes, but it eventually passes. Even if it takes days or weeks for any relief, it will eventually pass. \nThat was a little wordy but what I'm getting at is that what you feel and think are not trivial. Every sensation that passes through your mind is significant and important, because you ARE experiencing it - the feeling or thought never would have occured in the first place if you weren't. \nThe next big point that I want to make is that the people in your life want to hear about these things from you. Maybe not everyone, and definitely not all the time (because even if time has stopped for us we still need to remember that time still moves for everyone else), but I 100% guarantee that you have someone in your life that is willing to hear about what's on your mind.\nI won't be able to say much more without straying into advice territory, so this is what I did to pull myself out of my head:\nA) I accepted that something was wrong and that there were professionals who not only knew more than me, but knew better. \nB) I accepted that I didn't have to control absolutely every aspect of my life in order to feel safe. Isolation and irritability cleaved a lot from my life, and that's okay.\nC) I accepted that getting anywhere in life takes a long time, often 3 or 4 times what I would initially expect. It's unreasonable to expect yourself to be instantly successful or good at what you do; allow yourself the time to make the early general mistakes before you zero in on the details\nD) I found ways to get advice about my problems without directly bringing them up; this was only really helpful to get me started, though. Being clear and concise of what you experience will allow others to help you much more.\nE) I got medicated\nF) I went to therapy\nEvery step is an insurmountable cliff with winds threatening to blow you off at any moment - but I know that with your dedication to becoming a better person that you will be able to do it.\nLet me know if you need anything clarified or expanded on, it's a little all over the place",

 "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

Instead it's common to find those who only offer to listen and/or say cliche phrases to make themselves feel better for their \"altruism\". Their listening can give me an insincere vibe because they sometimes don't say something that would indicate they actually heard what you were talking about. Has irked me considerably.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers\u2019 problems.",

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I\u2019m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don\u2019t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. \nBut anyway. All this came from one PM.

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.\nFor the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.\nNow when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much can't do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.\nWhich is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.\nI don't start PM's.

Most of the time, help isn't generalized, it's personalized by nature. Not everyone's depression look the same, some advice can trigger anxiety in others while it can be a wake-up call to some.   \nGenerally a common way of dealing with depression from a CBT perspective is things like training mindfulness and practicing it often. But this is extremely hard for people with diagnoses like ADD, ADHD to get a working routine on, I'm not saying to defend the \"PM you anytime\" but reddit is a horrendously bad forum to help people quickly, often people get replies during a week's period and some form of support group for this type of struggle, not when people are suicidal low, but still depressed enough to make it hinder their lives can be helped if we could setup some form of group chat to remind each other or give ideas of how to deal with certain situations. A lot of times people know what they need to do, but hearing someone else tell them to do it will be of great importance.",

We're not suggesting anything so superficial as lurkers happening to read exactly what they need to hear said to someone else.
