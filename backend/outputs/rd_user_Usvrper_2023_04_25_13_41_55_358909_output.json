Providing the end results without the reason they happen and need help makes you ignorant. They are also not animals, they are human beings trying to fucking survive the only way they know how to.

After we were done tho... yup. Wild. If I want to play games with my friends and bring someone home I\u2019d do it all again, which I handled it all well. I didn\u2019t flip on her I literally just blocked her so I was clearly fine with handling it and \u201cprepared\u201d, this sounds like it hits close to home with you.

TLDR warning: I\u2019m gonna copy paste my message to a friend on snap from the night, I didn\u2019t completely ghost I tried to be nice but here we go, So. She comes over.... literally cries at random for like two hours and I kept calming her down and she would go back to like really normal and ok to be around, then out of nowhere she randomly says she\u2019s horny and wants to fuck so I ask like 7 times if we should be or if it\u2019ll make\nHow she\u2019s feeling worse. She\u2019s So persistent so we end up hooking up. Like 2 min after we\u2019re done my boy calls me and tells me to get on apex. So I\u2019m like ok... nut busted lemme bring her home then I\u2019ll be on. As soon as I hung up the phone she looks at me THROWS HER PHONE AND SCREAMS \u201cYOURE REALLY BRINGING ME HOME FUCK YOU\u201d AND STARTS BELIGERANTLY CRYINGGGGG telling me I\u2019m a piece of shit and this and that so I just remain calm and try and get her to my car, she hid in my bathroom for 35 minutes and then I was finally able to get her to my car, The entire ride back is a joke. She\u2019s just sobbing and telling me I used her and shit??? Then I get to her house and she sits there and refuses to her out. So I go \u201chave a good night!\u201d And she fucking yells again, throws her phone at my window and cracks my windshield then slams my car door as hard as she can. So I was pissed but I just let it go and drove off... I\u2019m driving home and she texts me 67 FUCKING TIMES. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it ok I just over reacted it was good and I\u2019m sorry I just didn\u2019t want to be your whore for the night\u201d \u201clooks like I ruined everything I guess\u201d\nTLDR: she kept spazzing on me and kicking my dashboard, threw her phone at my wall and put a hole in my wall, called me a ton of names this entire time I\u2019m just remaining silent and trying to just get her home",

Making the game easier for people just creates a chance based win every game. It\u2019s not even about who\u2019s the best in the lobby (which why shouldn\u2019t it be?) it\u2019s about who got the luckiest. The mobility items are sick, like the grappling hook and new impulse grenades and such. My opinion on double pump is that\u2019s not needed, I think pump tac was the best set up but I\u2019d even be fine with shotguns one shotting if they kept the two second delay so people can\u2019t double pump but have to switch to an SMG after the shotgun shot.",

Miniguns can literally melt people, and just rip through peoples mats, a 1v2+ against a team with a minigun is the most toxic thing ever. I'd rather shotguns and building over spraying and praying and not being able to do anything against a team of 4 all day.",
