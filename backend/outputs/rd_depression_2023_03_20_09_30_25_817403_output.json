 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.\nIn addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  \nIf you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers\u2019 problems.",

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I\u2019m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don\u2019t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. \nBut anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk.",

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.\nFor the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.\nNow when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much can't do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.\nWhich is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.\nI don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort.",

It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

So it's appropriate for people to be wary of offers of help that come this way.\nI'm not totally certain if your concern is for people who might want to ask for support in private (which as the post says is always okay although it still carries some risks) or for people who want to offer help in PMs, though...?

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

It's common to worry about burdening others with our problems, especially when they have their own lives and struggles to deal with.\nBut please know that you're not a bother to anyone. Friends and loved ones are there to support each other through thick and thin. It's okay to lean on them when you're going through a tough time. And if you don't feel comfortable talking to someone you know, there are always resources available, such as hotlines and counseling services.\nI want you to know that I care about you and I'm here to listen if you ever need to talk. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you want someone to talk to. Remember, you're not alone and it's okay to ask for help.",

 "text": "Should I let my friendship fade away for their own good So, I have this friend who's doing pretty good in life. He has a well paying job that he loves. A girlfriend and many other friends. When I look at myself I see that I, don't have a job, horrible in public settings and pretty much spend most the time I talk to him feeling envious of him. I'm a loser who doesn't really have a life to look forward too. I can tell my friend has developed over the past 3 years as well. We are both 21 but it feels very obvious that he has a more adult life. The way he talks to people is normal and he can start conversations with others well. While with me it's kinda just me being an awkward loser who tries to be funny. So my question to you all is. Should I just start slowly ghosting him so he can get me out of his life. I feel like I'm only holding him backhes made it clear that he hates people like me (not me specificall but how he described it, was basically like me) he's my only friend and I know ill be pretty lonely but should I? Nobody will probably read this anyways.",

I still can\u2019t make myself work, I can\u2019t focus for some reason even though I think my major is interesting. I\u2019m so deeply sad and anxious. I\u2019m just a passive coward. I hate doing bad in life and it makes me more depressed, but I was already fucking depressed when I was doing good. Like wtf????? What am I supposed to do?? Everyone acts like they have answers when really, no one has a clue what to do. No one knows how to fix me. I doubt I can. My brain always finds a way to make me doubt myself. Never once have I had confidence in what I do. I freeze in most social situations and just say something stupid.\nI hate people who preach \u201cdopamine detox\u201d and say it helped them get through their \u201cdepression\u201d.

But I never loved it in the first place, and if I did, I\u2019ve already forgotten what that felt like.\nSorry I\u2019m angry rn lol, just needed to vent.

When I stare in the mirror, I don't see myself looking back, there's just a guy standing there. Maybe he was me once, but he feels like a stranger now. When I think of my dog, whom I've had for 2 years at this point, I don't feel anything. When I think of my parents, both of whom I am very close with, I don't feel anything. When I look at my hands, they don't feel like my hands, they feel like two seperate entities doing what I tell them. I've tried to reconnect with myself by doing some of the things I used to enjoy, but still, nothing. I don't feel the need to eat food or drink water. I need to set a reminder so I don't forget. My parents are trying to improve my situation, but I fear that the person they long to see the return of is already gone. I feel like I'm piloting a corpse, while having his memories. It's hard to explain exactly how I feel, that's the best I can do. Is this normal in depression or am I another kind of f'ed up?",

I have to admit, I'm 32 now and have a number of acquaintances and some work friends, but only one or two good friends.\nBut please know you're not the problem, and neither am I. A lot of people are alone in college (despite what the media would have us believe about college being the best years of your life). But you might want to look at your interactions with people you tried to become friends with to see if you notice any patterns. Were you just trying with the wrong people (people who wouldn't be a good fit for friendship or weren't looking for new friends)? Did you come on too strong/expect a good friendship to form too quickly (that's my problem often)? \nKeep going to some of those clubs, though. Even if you don't make good friends out of it, it'll give you something to do and a sense of purpose. I worked for the student radio station in undergrad, and even though it only resulted in a couple of very loose friendships, it was still nice to see people when I went to the studio.",

 "text": "I don't see myself living for much longer I've made this throwaway as a couple of people I know know my main Reddit account. I'm 25 years old and have been living away from home for almost a year. I'm from Ireland but am living in London after following a big career opportunity, and so far it's going ok. A lot of downs, but a few ups so I guess it's all been balancing out.\nI guess I don't really have a segue to saying this, but I don't feel like I can live for much longer. I've no health complications/issues, I'm relatively healthy physically, but mentally I'm not ok. I feel sad and lonely a lot of the time. My family and girlfriend are back home and I miss them so much. I've noticed I've been drinking a lot over the last few months (not always getting shitfaced, but having something to get the lightest buzz) and whenever I visit home I smoke weed most nights. These substances make me feel a lot better than I do without.\nI've ticked off a number of things on my bucket list such as see my favourite band live, meet said favourite band, work in my desired career field, find a partner I feel happy with, move out of my parents house, etc. I know my bucket list isn't super exciting or long, but I can't think of anything else to add on to it.\nI spend most weekends at my flat, browsing the internet aimlessly and trying to find something to do with my couple of days off. Admittedly, a few weeks ago I'd gone out with a friend of mine for a few drinks and when I was waiting for my train to arrive, all I could think about was ending my life. It just came out of nowhere, I wasn't even feeling sad or helpless, it came into my head and took over - clearly I didn't act upon it. Since then I've realised that I don't see myself living much longer. I don't have a plan for ending my life, but I can't see myself living to 30 (that's only five years away). I struggle to plan for things that are less than a year away becasuse I put so little thought into the future, I just try and plan things day-by-day or week-by-week.\nI haven't expressed any of this with anyone in my life because I don't see them often or else they live back home, and I don't want to scare anyone. I don't really know what to do with myself.",

 "text": "I\u2019m feeling worthless and down a lot lately and would like some perspectives that come from other people that could help me become stronger or challenge my difficult feelings I\u2019m currently recovering from a really bad anxious collapse that happened me over a year ago now. My mother had me when she was 20 (single mother) and met another man who she married and had my 3 siblings with. I never met my biological dad and gre up looking different to my peers. This caused me to be bullied by 4 different groups throughout my teens. I drank and used drugs to cope from 13-20 until I got brought to court and it was a wake up call. I went back to university as an adult, even got a scholarship after undergrad to go to another country but I never really felt confident about who I am or that I had any worth. Especially to women. I had one relationship in my 20s that lasted almost 5 years. I dated someone who I wasn\u2019t really physically attracted to. I did love her, she had a kind heart and took care of me. I always felt guilty though about not really feeling physical attraction for her. I think subconsciously I must have thought that the only type of love I was worthy of was from someone I would not feel attracted to or my perception that she was not what I felt was attractive meant she was less likely to abandon me. I know how narcissistic and awful that sounds trust me. I\u2019m just trying to be honest. When that relationship ended I decided that if I was going to date anyone again I must be attracted to them physically in some way at least. \nFast forward 6 years and I haven\u2019t been on a date since. I could count on one hand the amount of times I\u2019ve even been hugged since then. All my life I\u2019ve felt invisible to women. I really wanted to meet someone and start a family. I thought \u201cmost people meet someone eventually and get married, that will probably happen me too\u201d, well, it hasn\u2019t\nNow my focus is on trying to figure out ways of managing life with no one there to complement me, encourage me, or think of me for the next 20 years. Which is how it\u2019s been for most of the last 20. Sometimes I feel so down and sad. It\u2019s really tough trying to reassure yourself when you get so little validation from others. I feel like I will have to explain over and over to people in the future that I\u2019m not married and don\u2019t have a family. It makes my eyes fill with tears because I don\u2019t know why no women seemed to want me that I showed interest in. I don\u2019t know if it was looks or personality or my anxious standoffishness. \nI feel resentful when I hear about people who screwed people over and treated people badly while I was growing up now having wives and a couple kids, and the feel like I\u2019m worthless. When I was younger I felt bad because I felt invisible to girls then too. I don\u2019t think as people we were designed to be alone but I feel such strong rejection now that I have decided to give up on my hopes of having a family and try to find ways to live alone and be happy. I had the idea that I could donate some of my earnings to children in need anonymously as a way to show love to children. I also want to volunteer somewhere as a way to help I. The community. I really feel like the only way to experience less emotional pain in the future is by limiting the amount of interaction I have with people and keep to myself because when I see others with the things I\u2019m not able to achieve it gives me deep feelings of sadness. I\u2019m go to therapy and take medication but I\u2019m just r stuck and not feeling any better",

It was a long trail, some parts were shady and a bit hilly. In the fall all the leaves turned orange and red and they swayed a certain way in the wind. \nI didn\u2019t care about school. I did my work at home so when it was time to actually go in there was nothing for me to do but walk down that path. My school only had about 20 other girls, a little while after Covid everyone chose to stay online but I\u2019d still come in along with maybe a couple others. I only came to school because of that path behind the building.\nI only really felt at ease then. It was my last year of being a \u2018high schooler\u2019 and I felt like my time to be sentimental was running out. I just wanted to walk down that path everyday of my life and admire the trees. But I knew that when I graduated I\u2019d have to move far away onto a university campus where everyone is always moving too damn fast for me. I hate the city, it makes me feel so lonely. \nI just want to walk down that private path once again. No one really knew about it but me, it was so special to me.\nThinking about it is painful. Those quiet moments are gone, I can\u2019t feel like that again. It\u2019s already been 2 years since then and everyday I feel like those moments get farther and farther away from me.\nI don\u2019t know where to go from here",

Have you seen a mental health specialist? \nThere are treatments for this, including certain meds, cognitive behavioral therapy, or transcranial magnetic stimulation. You might not find the right treatment at first, and might have to try different ones before you find the one that works, but you can get better. \nI finally stumbled on the right combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine, sometimes referred to as California rocket fuel. Those are two different antidepressants. They are often used together for treatment-resistant depression, and venlafaxine by itself is often used for anxiety.",

I'm studying to get into medical College and i have been preparing for it since 2021. Basically, mom had me choose this stream, i wanted to do something related to arts, but i ended up doing what mom said anyways. I used to study till last year, just because i didn't want to get embarassed in class, and i haven't failed any of my exams, but i still dont want to do anything related to medical. Now I'm feeling really tired of studying for something i don't want to do. I feel like I'm wasting my time for nothing. My classes ended in Nov, now since jan-feb, whole day i just feel like sitting on one place and stare into nothing. Mom expects me to study all the time so i just open my book in front of me and keep staring out of the window whole day. I don't have any friends so i don't have anyone to talk to, i used to love reading, baking, drawing, gaming but now i have completely lost interest in doing any of those, also I'm not allowed to do that, like i said mom expects me to study all the time. I literally haven't left my house for 2 years, except for school/classes. Mom tells me to study till at least 3 am and wake up by 7, then only I will get admission in good college, so i stay up till then just to satisfy my mom so i barely get 3-4 hrs of sleep everyday. And i just feel so tired of this, i just want all this to end. Even if i decide that maybe i should try to study for atleast an hour, my mind just wanders off somewhere else, i have zero concentration for few months. I keep wishing that i wasn't born and hope that something happens with me so i don't have to deal with this anymore. Also i feel really guilty that my mom spent so much for my school, books, etc and i cant even concentrate for 5 min. I feel bad that mom has spent so much money for education on someone like me, im done with my finals and i have passed those, but the entrance exams for college i keep wishing i fail cuz if i get admission in med college then i will be wasting my 5 years but if i fail mom's gonna be so disappointed in me. Idk i just feel guilty for cheating my mom like that, and i feel so pathetic for feeling like this, since I'm not the only one \"preparing\" for medical.\nAnyways ty for reading guys",

I work in a little casino in a deprived area that actively makes people's lives worse, but I can't leave because of money. My girlfriend convinced me to do a degree in History because I love the subject however now I am at the point where I feel like this was a mistake because the job prospects are dismal. I have no friends. My life is work, uni work and hang out with my girlfriend.\nRegarding my future, what future do I have to look forward to? I have absolutely no purpose in life. I do not want kids. I wish I did, but I don't. I most likely will not have a fulfilling career. I probably won't make a lot of money. So what is the point? I might as well kill myself because I can already map out how my life is going, and it is not positive at all.",

The other tricks you into thinking that there are many other players and a cohesive world. (Reality)\nThis is my understanding. I think that reality becomes less fearful and depressing when we see it as a sort of dream that is just a little more structured. \nWe still have power over it, but it takes patience and diligence to make any progress. We have to learn to give up our need for a quick fix and for perfection and achievement or love. We need to learn to consistently come back to the present and to develop a grateful heart. Stop being so fucking selfish & spread a little joy. Do you want to be a part of the problem or the solution?",

I actually liked both pair of shoes and they fit who I truly am when I'm not hiding. \nMind you the store was very busy and multiple people heard them say this to me and looked at me with absolutely crushing pity. \n-I know it seems silly to be upset over shoes, but that's not it. I was actually genuinely happy and excited by something and haven't been in a long time.\n-Needless to say I have been silent since leaving the store.

I sat in my room alone as I started to ask myself \u201cam I real\u201d I went on Google and searched up what I was feeling the more posts I read the more I felt exactly how those people in the comment section felt. I felt like I was high and was about to faint. But I read Thoughts of those who said they wanted to die or those who said a lot of other things. I even called the suicidal hotline, as I am writing this I am starting to feel the symptoms again but this time I know better. To those of you who are struggling at the moment this might not be much help to you but it helped me today you do not need to stop thinking negative thoughts because the more you try the more it\u2019ll be instead focus your thoughts on something I know it\u2019s hard but even talking to someone at the moment might help you. Please and I mean please get yourself a therapist if you have not done so I am not a professional but today made me realize how important and intense suicidal thought can be. Your mind is one of the strongest weapons to ever exist and sometimes that weapon may turn against you, but it will not prosper. You\u2019re mind is very powerful and the things that you go through just proves that, your thoughts are not your reality and if you have not done so I advise you to go on YouTube and listen to Sadhguru he has helped me today. And I hope he\u2019ll help you too. I hope that soon you\u2019ll be okay enough to even leave this chat if you feel like. I hope you\u2019ll be happy again. I hope you\u2019ll have control over your life again and have a will to live. I hope you get better.",

Lately I just haven\u2019t been able to. I sit in my bed almost all day if I don\u2019t have work and usually end up smoking to deal with the feelings of sadness that come up. \nI haven\u2019t smoked today in an effort to be more alert and focused but I still can\u2019t get out of bed. I\u2019ve also been extremely irritable with my friends and family. I have a very strong desire to isolate which is made worse by the fact I\u2019m extremely exhausted and don\u2019t have the energy to talk. I just feel so empty and disgusting inside. I just want to smoke to feel kind of okay but I know I\u2019ll be hazy for the rest of the day. \nI\u2019m just not sure how to start feeling better.",

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and to struggle with doing things that used to come easily to you.\nIt's great that you're trying to make positive changes by not smoking today, but please don't beat yourself up if you don't feel instantly better. Recovery is a process, and it takes time and effort to get to a better place.\nIt might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through. They can provide you with strategies for managing your symptoms, as well as help you work through any underlying issues that might be contributing to how you're feeling.\nIn the meantime, try to be kind to yourself. Allow yourself to rest and take things one day at a time. Remember that it's okay to ask for help, and that you don't have to go through this alone.\nI care about you and I'm here to support you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you ever need someone to talk to.\nFYI: I used to smoke for 15 years and it\u2019s been 2 years since I quit, I feel much better now.",

Today, I was accused of being a liar by a woman I finally met Friday night (online dating) who said I was not two inches taller than her, so I must not be an honest person. Wow, we remember things differently. When I said that I felt interrogated (she is a deputy, and her line of questioning was accusatory IMO), she immediately accused me of being someone who turns things around on the other person (I will have to look at that, of course, my nature is about introspection and self-improvement, sooooooo...). \n\u200b\nWork sucks. I was told about 8 weeks ago to start looking for a new role within my company because my boss wasn't going to have work for me soon, and it was my responsibility to find something new. Okay... well then. So I'm exploring opportunities within and outside of my company, and the level and amount of rejection in job hunting is soul crushing. \nSo, I'm not having luck in dating. I'm not having luck in job hunting. I'm likely going to have to relocate regardless of where I find a job, and I'm struggling to accept the uncertainty, I guess. I'm struggling to accept that I don't know where I fit in.

 "text": "It is exhausting to live with depression and anxiety For an idea, i am 22 and in my final semester of college. Ive struggled with anxiety and depression since early elementary school. In the last year i started regularly going to therapy, and found some meds that work really well, and entered a new relationship with a very realistic but optimistic person (26, psych major for counseling and therapy, what a duo lol)\nWithin the last few months i cant help but feel impending doom. On the days where I\u2019m okay and my medication helps, i am great.\nOn the bad days its just exhausting. Ive been with my partner for over a year now, this is the healthiest relationship Ive ever had. I see endgame with him. We\u2019ve had little bumps but nothing we cant work through.\nWe both graduate in may (grad school for him) and i am just feeling major senioritis. I dont know what to do after school. Work until i die? When i was a preteen i didnt think i was going to make it to 18 so, what now?\nAgain, the days that are good are good, but some days i just feel that I\u2019ve messed up beyond repair. Ive messed my life up, or I\u2019m too messed up. My bf shows he loves me and is very understanding, but i feel insecure lately because i just love him so much and i feel like my mental problems will bring him down or make him sick of me. He says its not and that we\u2019re okay and I\u2019m okay. The joke is; every time im afraid of \u201cmessing up\u201d our relationship I apologize, and every time i apologize and over explain im like \u201cthis is the thing thats messing it up\u201d i feel that I\u2019m too messed up to fix, and Im not worth being in a relationship with.\nHe says he loves me and shows it and i have no reason not to believe him, but my brain tells me I\u2019m not deserving of that love.\nI cannot just act confident and ignore these instincts because i feel stupid for being confident that someone loves me, because i am not worth loving.\nWe will live about an hour apart during summer and that is stressing me out.\nI feel that i am existing just to exist. It is so painful to be aware of my impulsive thoughts and overthinking and anxious attachment style because i know its an issue and theres \u201cnothing\u201d i can do about it, and i feel like being aware of it will just manifest it.\nIts cyclical and sickening, i have a weight on my chest and it paralyzes me. I am so afraid of letting myself sabotage a relationship bc its going \u201ctoo smoothly\u201dthat i fear i am doing just that. Its so exhausting to be self aware. \nI am on meds that help and in therapy, and i WANT to be better, but i just cant make it go away. Now that im in my 20s im convinced it never will. I feel like a Sim doing my tasks every day just to make it to the next day",

 "text": "I don't see myself living for much longer I've made this throwaway as a couple of people I know know my main Reddit account. I'm 25 years old and have been living away from home for almost a year. I'm from Ireland but am living in London after following a big career opportunity, and so far it's going ok. A lot of downs, but a few ups so I guess it's all been balancing out.\nI guess I don't really have a segue to saying this, but I don't feel like I can live for much longer. I've no health complications/issues, I'm relatively healthy physically, but mentally I'm not ok. I feel sad and lonely a lot of the time. My family and girlfriend are back home and I miss them so much. I've noticed I've been drinking a lot over the last few months (not always getting shitfaced, but having something to get the lightest buzz) and whenever I visit home I smoke weed most nights. These substances make me feel a lot better than I do without.\nI've ticked off a number of things on my bucket list such as see my favourite band live, meet said favourite band, work in my desired career field, find a partner I feel happy with, move out of my parents house, etc. I know my bucket list isn't super exciting or long, but I can't think of anything else to add on to it.\nI spend most weekends at my flat, browsing the internet aimlessly and trying to find something to do with my couple of days off. Admittedly, a few weeks ago I'd gone out with a friend of mine for a few drinks and when I was waiting for my train to arrive, all I could think about was ending my life. It just came out of nowhere, I wasn't even feeling sad or helpless, it came into my head and took over - clearly I didn't act upon it. Since then I've realised that I don't see myself living much longer. I don't have a plan for ending my life, but I can't see myself living to 30 (that's only five years away). I struggle to plan for things that are less than a year away becasuse I put so little thought into the future, I just try and plan things day-by-day or week-by-week.\nI haven't expressed any of this with anyone in my life because I don't see them often or else they live back home, and I don't want to scare anyone. I don't really know what to do with myself.",

It wouldn't unfortunately be exactly like flying, but it might give you a means to engage in a hobby that your kids could also participate in. You need some time to unwind, really any time you can get, because if you don't, it'll just get more and more exhausting to live life.\nIt'll also make your life more difficult if you let this nostalgia over a past relationship consume you, but the only way you can overcome this is by making a change in your married life. If you want to continue your marriage, seek marriage counseling. If you don't, seek separation. Either way, you need to talk to your wife and express exactly how you feel.\nI wish you all the best, OP. If you can take a break today, take a walk or hang out with your kids. Whatever can make you feel just a bit of happiness.",

 "text": "I lost my uncle last night, 4 months after I lost my aunt (his wife) To preserve my privacy, I will refer to my uncle as \"R\", and my aunt as \"C\"\nIf you were to scroll far enough on my account, you would find the post I made the night C died, and how I felt that night. Overall, I felt fine, purely down to shock. I was not very close to C but if I bumped into her while she was at work, I would stop and say hello, or speak to her during parties. It was a rough time for my family, and very challenging for me to work through due to it being the first substantial death in my family, one that really affected me due to the reactions around me, and the utter guilt I felt from not experiencing grief. She died on the 20th of December, 5 days before Christmas, after falling into a sudden coma despite being overall healthy. The immediate news didn't affect me at all, nor the announcement of her death, but the funeral broke me. I had a panic attack as the curtain was drawn to transfer her coffin into the furnace. The next day, I overdosed.\nR died yesterday during a car jumpstart by just simply slumping over, and dying (heart attack). He was revived, but soon took another one and that was the end of his life. He was taken as quickly as C was, Many of my family members believe he died of a broken heart, which makes the entire situation so much worse for me to work through. It would be selfish of me to be upset about his death due to maybe speaking to him once or twice in my life, but when we used to talk about the couple, they were always talked about together, never individually, so for example, \"I'm going to C and R's house.\". I haven't really managed to grieve C's death, so grieving R's too is going to be so tough. I'm not nearly as mentally unwell as I was at the time of C's death, so this hasn't pushed me over the edge as far as I'm currently aware, but I'm sure I'll be able to figure that out after the initial shock has worn off\nTo finish, I am not a religious person, so I can't lean back on the idea that they have been reunited in heaven, however much I would love to take comfort in that idea. I wish I was religious to an extent so that I could have an answer or at least a sense of relief that they're together forever, but it's a cold, lonely world that I live in, and I know that this is the final journey. I know that as soon as C's eyes closed to submit to her coma, that was the last time R ever looked into his wife's soul.\nI'm getting too deep here, I apologise. I'm just upset.",

I used to overthink everything, I used to be so severely depressed I did nothing. It's been so long, I don't even feel depressed anymore. I used to turn to philosophy to change my perspective of life and it did, i'm absolutely a better person for it. These days I don't even think much anymore. I stopped smoking weed, i'm drinking less but my mind hasn't returned. There's been multiple stages of my life, i'm still a young man i'm only 25, where i've felt i would never live to see that age. I don't want to be a person anymore, i don't like other people. Still other people love me, everyone i work with and meet have nothing but good things to say. Still everyones perspective come from idealized version they were raised, taught, or told to believe and often times from a lens of their own past experiences. I can't do it anymore. I'm alone in society and always have been, and by myself I am nothing. I'd rather be nothing. I don't want to be a misanthrope, I don't want to be anything but nothing. I don't like being human. I'm exhausted with life. I can't even express myself. I live to just be, I just am. I can't even want anymore. I don't even know what it means to want. I'm blind, deaf, and numb to existence.",

I had friends who I became distant with, my mother is on her own way of processing her divorce with my scumbag dad, so I lost my father first hand the moment he started beating my mom. In my entire life, I listened to music 24/7 cutting out the people I felt awkward, out of place with. I have no lover to comfort me and show me that there is still hope and I have a way to be happy. I struggle to find it on my own, so a little help never hurts. When I celebrated, I had music and a beer with a game of chess on my phone. Music expresses my feelings and whatever I play, it matches my mood or emotions I am facing. I tried hitting a bar, but I was hung over so it didn't feel as good as I thought it would feel. I want to cry out every ounce of tears out of my eye and turn off my brain to be myself. I am a man, I can't cry, I can take anything. I have no emotions so it won't matter how hurt I am. I want to be treated as a human being. I want to be happy too, because I deserve it as much as anyone else. Not more or less, I am equal to my peers and to every single person. I think I ask too much I guess.",

It's important to seek help and talk to someone about how you're feeling, whether it's a friend, family member, or a mental health professional.\nRemember that you are not alone in this, and that you are worthy of love and friendship. Try not to let negative thoughts take over and instead focus on your strengths and the things that make you unique. It's okay to take some time for yourself, but also consider reaching out to your friends and spending time with them. They may be more supportive than you think.\nFinally, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone has their own struggles and insecurities, and it's okay to be imperfect. Be kind to yourself and take small steps towards building your confidence and self-esteem.",

He passed away almost 3 years ago and in the time we have celebrated him more than I have ever been celebrated. Mom and I were watching tv the other day and she remarked that she never had birthday parties growing up. I said neither did I. She disagreed telling me about all these parties until I pointed out that those parties were for my brother and sometimes sister. Then it was the same lecture I got after he died: \u201cit\u2019s not that he was the favorite it\u2019s just that he had a special relationship with my parents that me and my sister could never experience because he saved their marriage/made them parents/he was the only son.\u201d My birthday is usually forgotten because it\u2019s right around Thanksgiving. I had a sweet sixteen that wound up being more of a family party with pink decorations. \nBeing the one never chosen has effected me forever. I was such a pick me it must have been annoying. I was chosen first once in my life:by my husband, the greatest person I know. And I feel like he\u2019s lived to regret that choice. I\u2019ve tried to make life what we wanted but it seems to kick us in the ass at every turn because of me: employment issues for both but especially for me, medical issues on my side, two miscarriages in the last 2 years, living with our families the last 8 years of our 11 year marriage. And he\u2019s broken I think. \nNow he\u2019s going back to drinking and watching porn/playing pornographic video games constantly lying about it to me. I beg for his touch and attention but who would want a middle aged fat useless barren wife to look forward to coming home to?",

Since i was a kid i'm struggling with episodes of depression and anxiety, now, i am at the point when i just don't know what to do anymore. Somedays i just feel good and i say to myself \"yeah ok everything's gonna be alright you can make it\" and then, the day after it or even the same evening i just feel like i'm not able to do anything, i just lay in the bed and let the time go away. Also i'm having some problems with staying sober. Everyday after school, if i don't have weed to smoke i drink alcohol, if there is no alcohol i smoke weed, no matter what i just can't stay sober. And if i have to, i'm just angry all the time and avoid anyone, i just lay in the bed. I have hobbies and interests, even a dream work (psychiatrist lol), but i don't have the motivation to pursue them, so i'm always \"the same\". Hope someday i'll figure out how to make it all work.\nThank you.",

It's definitely something to look into while you're a student.\nRegardless, I really hope you feel better soon. If possible, pick up one thing that you can do that could help you feel better. Whether it's a pre-existing hobby or a new one, having something to do can help take your mind off of things and provide you with a source of joy, even if it's just for a little while. It may not solve your problems, but such a thing can help provide a little bit of relief.\nTreasure your mom and dad and spend time with them if you can. Whenever you feel ready, try to find friends in your area / college that can also provide you joy and support. Don't rush into socialization, especially since you aren't feeling well right now. \nTry to take it easy and just do what you need to do to survive. It's okay. You'll thank yourself for it later. Take small steps towards improving your mental health and your situation; change doesn't need to be immediate for it to be powerful and long-lasting.\nPlease don't give up. Take it slow and steady. Don't pressure yourself, especially during such a hard time. Give yourself the love you deserve.",

Unfortunately our emotions don't know what can be changed and what can't.\nIf you can't change it, you must accept it and use it to your advantage, not let it cause you a disadvantage.\nIt might be just what you need! You might meet a girl and hangout with her. Or now that you don't have too many distractions you can FOCUS on school and get good grades, graduate with honors, geta accepted to a better college and give you a better future.\nWho knows though right?... you can just sit back and watch and cry as it crumbles around you because you don't do anything about it....

This depression had caused me to push important people in my life away. I\u2019ve said things I don\u2019t mean and I don\u2019t even know why. Why do we do these things when we are feeling this way? Why push people away when you need them most? I said things that are so hurtful. I can\u2019t take them back.

Dealing with a depression on top of a heartache feels so heavy, and I know it\u2019s my own fault. My hopes to anyone going through something similar, is to try and open up to the people who care.

There are success story of certain parenting style, yet the same style is frowned upon elsewhere.\nBecause of it, there's no way to \"certify\" parents on how to raise kids. That means it makes sense for parents to raise their kids just like themselves, it's what they already know. Why would they try to experiment on their own kids? There's no guarantee other style would work better.\n\u200b\nI don't know why people romanticized adoption nowadays, be it human or pet. It sounds noble but not without trouble. Orphaned kids (or pet) tend to have mental issue like us. If a couple willing to do so, that's great, but most parents barely know how to raise normal kids.",

It's like im rising and the more I rise the harder I plummet. I'm so sick and tired of this. I really do want to give up, I cant take it anymore but I dont wanna leave my boyfriend. I wanna have a future with him, but I cant do this anymore.  I dont even know what to do in the future. I dont know what to do in the future, im going to college next year and I dont even know what course to take. I want to give my boyfriend everything in the future but I don't know how to, because I dont even know what career to do in the future. I dont have anything that im actually passionate about. I don't have anything that drives me. My boyfriend and my dog are the only reason I'm still here. This week I feel like my world revolves around my boyfriend. It's probably because im unconsciously clinging to my last reason to live. Im unconsciously making him my everything because I know that if I dont, I might actually do it. I ran out of motivation and reasons to live. He is the last reason and I'm clinging to it. Why cant I get better?

I'm not doing well at school, I have been numb for days and then I was trying to study Math and it triggered me. I just started to breakdown because I cant understand it. How am I supposed to have a nice future If I cant even understand math. I'm not doing well with my family either nor with friends. My family keeps comparing me to my greatest friend and it's bs. My family isn't content with my scores nor with anything with me. I'm trying my best to get out of bed yet my family is here complaining about how I didn't get a perfect score or something. My family knows that my grandpa has been harassing me for years yet they turn a blind eye to it. My family emotionally abuses me and I cant take it. I want to stop caring about everyone's feelings but I cant leave my boyfriend. I really dont want to leave him. I'm trying hard to keep holding on but I just cant.",

 "text": "Autophobia is scary I wanted to reflect after reading another post that I feel summarizes depression quite well.\nWhat is it like to undergo depression? How does it feel? How does one deal with it? How important is it to be patient when dealing with depression?\nDepression affects everyone differently. Sometimes it's been inside the whole time, waiting to strike at the right moment. Other times it's something that will never really go away because of things beyond our control. This is my summary of how I've been feeling over the last couple months after 10+ years of hurt.\n\nI wasn't always like this. I used to dream of using technology to improve the world. Used to spend hours beat mixing albums and organizing / editing photos. Used to see value in working for a pittance. Used to be independent. Some people even say I used to smile in photographs. Not anymore. None of that matters when life feels like it's not progressing at all. What do you do when everything feels pointless?\nThe only thing keeping me going is a close group of friends who do stuff on weekends. Nothing else matters more than having people who will support my struggles, who I'd do the same for in return. The thought or actuality of losing those friends scares the crap out of me. I know the only constant in life is change, but Autophobia is real and hurts so much.\nNow, living at home isn't so bad; rent is cheap, we have family meals, and people are around. However, I can't help but feel like doing the same thing with the same people in the same house for 3+ decades is part of the problem. Our worldly socio-economic policies don't help either, but I know I can't change those so I'm trying not to focus on them too much.\nPart of me wants to move out, both to grow and live life to its fullest. However, I'm also deathly afraid of moving out without someone who will help keep my mind grounded, remind me to function, and be there when (not if) I have another mental breakdown. It's not my friends responsibility to watch over me, but I need friends around to help qualm my Autophobia.\nAll we can do is learn to cope with each passing day. I'm still at home, learning to cope as best I can, all while trying to find the motivation to move forward with life, whatever that looks like. I hope you can find peace in your life too, because we all deserve to live a fulfilling life with as little complications as necessary.",

I always hear stories of people who have made suicide attempts and despite the outcome of how it failed, are glad they survived it.\nBefore i was even 10, i made an attempt, failed. I was poor, my parents separately abandoned me and raised their own kids. I did all these checklist things. I found people who love me and regularly show they love me, lasting throughout more than a decade now. I went to school, got a doctorate. My job appreciates me (i feel) and i make 6 figures, a long way from dropping a gallon of milk and not being able to afford more for a week. I went to therapy, tried medications. I bought a new car, bought a house i wanted. Ive traveled alone, traveled internationally with friends. I go out, i socialize, i meet people and try to learn about their different human experiences. I sing karaoke and the crowd cheers, even though im not even vocally talented. I have people who regularly tell me and show me that they are there for me or at least can help or guide me. The worst part of my days are really just inconveniences or annoyances. I have my cat and my dog that are 11 and 14 respectively, ive had then since they were babies and they are well and happy and i think that also says a lot about me as a person. Most of the time i feel like i am genuine to myself and my values. Its a good life. \nBut even after all this, i was never glad my attempt failed. Everyday i wake and do things because its expected. The only thing that keeps me going is not wanting to bring sadness to anyone that loves me. I feel like its the only part of me that isnt truthful or genuine. I dont know why i dont love anything or anyone. I just say i love you to people because i couldnt bring any sadness to anyone that does love me. I cant bring myself to tell anyone that i dont love then back. \nIm stuck because i thought this is what i wanted to finally be happy and to love. I cant think of a better job. Or what more i could want from the people that surround me. I dont know what more i even want from me (except to be grateful or love something or just damn be happy). Between luck opportunity and hard work, i have a good life.\nBut still, I regret the attempt hadnt worked out.",

I feel really depressed and have experienced my first anxiety attack ever. Ever since I finished my degree I've been financially stressed but kept my just above water. Now this is my first time posting ever, and also I'm just so confussed about everything so sorry if this doesn't really makes sense.\nRecently though it feels as if my life is falling completely apart. My wife, the love of my life, and I do LARP with our group. Now, last time we went I got really tired, and we ended up having a fight when we got back home from the event. And that fight became the drop that made my glass overflow. My ex and I broke up after a LARP event because we had a fight and she ended up cheating on me, it wasn't very pretty and has left me with a fear of being left behind and loosing people.\nDuring the last event we went to, my wife's character got engaged to one of our very good friends' character. That on top of the fight, have apparently reignited my fears from my former trauma of the way my ex left me. They have been doing forum rp daily ever since the event so that their characters can get to know each other better; something we generally do in the group, but the added romantic relationship between my wife and friends' characters. At the same time, because of my fears I have started growing slightly possessive and am really working with that issue as well as the other issues I have. We've spent some time apart to try and deal with my fear of not being with her, in case she might leave then, and are currently apart again while she's gone to visit some friends.\nDuring these days however, it feels as if she's been withdrawing from me, not really answering me proberly or outright choosing to not engage with me in regards to any forum play we've been doing or in general, while I know she's been continuing with her own forumplay. My mind continues to make all sorts of scenarioes that scares me and just makes me want to have her in front of me and tell me she still loves me.\nMy depression and anxiety is growing worse, but I'm also afraid that if I keep communicating that to her, she'll grow annoyed and not want to spend time with me.\nI also have an appointment lined up with my doctor, as that might allow me to get financial aid with some therapy, but that is two weeks off and I feel as if I might crack any moment. I really don't know what to do and just need somewhere to vent. I've begun having these thoughts whether I'd just be saving us both a lot of pain by just running off and cutting ties to everything and starting over somewhere.. It's as if no matter what solution I'm thinking of there's no light at the end of the tunnel and I just have this fear that no matter how hard I try it's going to go wrong and she'll end up growing tired with the hardship anyway and end it..\nEverything just feels overwhelming",

I tried to quit porn many times but it's hard because it's an addiction, It became even harder when I had to deal with narcissistic abuse that, alongside porn and other stuff, led me to depression. So now depression eats me alive and addiction became a coping mechanism and I've been stuck in that cycle for a while now.\nI keep going back and forth between believing that my life is 100% my responsibility and believing that I was happy before I got abused so abuse takes the most blame for my situation. The addiction started before the abuse but I wasn't depressed yet. That addiction became 4x worse after the abuse.\nSo, is it 100% my fault ? Am I waking up everyday with the intention of making myself sad ? Does the \"happiness is a choice\" mindset apply to that situation ? Because if so then i don't get to complain right ?",

 "text": "Did your meds (antidepressants) actually work the way they are supposed to? If you just felt like a vegetable, with little emotion, while on them, you were on the wrong meds. Mine were only working so-so. I changed to what some in the mental health field call California rocket fuel, and it made all the difference. It's a two-med combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine and has become popular as a first-line treatment with some MH professionals, and it is often used for treatment-resistant depression. \nI also went through TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation--nothing like electroconvulsive therapy) sessions, which improved things somewhat. My anxiety and depression scores were significantly improved over the course of TMS treatments. I can recommend them, based on my personal experience, but they don't improve things for everyone, though they have zero side effects, which is more than can be said for meds. TMS is covered by most insurance, I'm told, and Medicare covers it. \nThere is also talk therapy, which is highly recommended to go along with pharmaceutical treatments. \nIf you've tried all of the above, there are still other avenues to try.\nBack to antidepressants. Besides the TCAs, SSRIs, and SNRIs, there are at least a couple of tetracyclic types, and then there is the MAOIs. The latter usually do work, but require some dietary restrictions to avoid serious side effects. \nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-major-classes-of-antidepressants-1065086\nOf course, you are familar with feeling the sadness of depression, and we tend to go back to what we're familiar with, so I think I understand where you're coming from. But if you want to feel anything like normal (not like you're \"drugged\"), there are more things you can do.",

It sounds like you've been struggling for a while now, and the winter months have only made things more difficult for you. I can totally understand how you feel, as winter can be a tough season for a lot of people.\nI'm glad to hear that you're seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, and that you're trying different medications to find something that works for you. It can be really frustrating when it takes a while for medications to start working, but it's important to remember that everyone's journey is different, and recovery is not always linear.\nHave you tried any other forms of treatment or self-care that might help you feel better? Sometimes, exercise, being outside in the sun, or practicing mindfulness can all help with managing depression. It might be worth exploring some other options and seeing if they work for you.\nI know it can feel really lonely when you're struggling with depression, but please know that you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep reaching out for help, and remember that things will get better with time.",

 "text": "I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time. It's understandable that after experiencing an unfaithful relationship and dealing with work pressure, you might feel isolated and alone. As for whether it's really hard to make friends when you're old, it's important to remember that age shouldn't be a barrier to making meaningful connections with others. It might require some effort and stepping out of your comfort zone, but there are plenty of opportunities to meet new people and forge friendships, whether it's through social clubs, volunteering, or simply striking up a conversation with someone new. \nIn the meantime, venting your frustrations and connecting with others online can also be a helpful way to cope with difficult emotions. Remember, you're not alone, and there are people out there who are willing to listen and support you.",

My only friends and the reason I push through. But I know I need some form of identity for myself. Because eventually they will have their own lives. \nI want to have someone to share life with. I want a job my Chilean be proud of me for. I want to be more than what I am today. I want to get out of this hamster wheel of a life. I just want to actually feel happy again.",

So for context I work for the NHS CAMHS (child and adolescent mental heath services) so technically it's my jobs and this isn't the first time I've technically saved but anyway. Point is was on escorted leave middle of town and they attempted to run into traffic, the result me and my colleague had to restrain them in the middle of town on a concrete path. Not ideal I know however safer then letting them run into traffic. Police came and helpted us return to the ward. \nSounds like a great thing preventing it but I cannot stop thinking about how terrified and potentially traumatised the witness's were, literally people that most likely havbt ever seen anything like that. I feel guilty that it even got that far, how did the nurses not see the risk before allowing leave  why were we not told about the risk, what could we have done differently. \nI'm struggling so much with the guilt of having thoes people see that. With the guilt of it getting that far (even tho wasn't my choice or decision). I look at the scrapes, bruises and cuts I have from the concrete. The bruises on my jaw amd chest from their kicks and punches and I can't not see how horrific it was for thoes people to witness. Just sucks how somthing that should be good can really get to your own mental health and can impact you. But I guess that's just part of the job. \nPeople are always shitting on CAHMS in the UK and don't get me wrong it needs a massive improvement but the support workers, thoes trying their upmost to change the lives of these kids, no one really knows the stuff we see or have to go through. \nI would like to say we did prevent them from injury, they are safe on the ward.",

Is this really a part of her response to medication? We did a follow-up check-up, and mentioned her suicidal thoughts and increasing anxiety. However, she was advised to just continue with her medication. I would like to know if any, among these, is aggravating her condition and exacerbating suicidal thoughts. Should she continue taking them as advised by her psychiatrist?\nLooking forward to your esteemed opinions. Thank you in advance!",

I don't even have a career and I'm too old and too limited by everything to get one, on top of being devoid of motivation because I've been depressed and anxious for, well, 2 decades, I guess. \nThere is no hope for me.

Luckily for me my mum is a psychologist and she did some research into what might help, she discovered a branch of medications known as SNRI\u2019s - they have completely changed my life (specifically Venlafaxine) I feel like my old self, the world is colourful again, I\u2019m curious and am enjoying life, my family and the little things. I was 100% sure they wouldn\u2019t work and I\u2019ve been completely proven wrong. Depression is an ILLNESS, and like most illnesses, there is effective treatment out there, you just have to keep trying different medicines until you find the one that works for your brain. Please, if you haven\u2019t tried them, give them a go. If they don\u2019t work, give something else a go. On another separate point, depression can be a symptom of other underlying mental health disorders, such as ADHD. Get yourself to a psychiatrist (General practitioners do not really know what they are talking about) and find out what\u2019s really going on in your head. Good luck :)",

There\u2019s no point in living, but whatever, maybe I\u2019ll find a reason someday to distract myself from the fact that there actually isn\u2019t a reason. \nAnyway, I sort of went into this \u201cIt is what it is, there\u2019s no point in getting mad/sad about this since I can\u2019t control the situation, I\u2019ll just accept everything.\u201d kind of mindset after a mental breakdown recently. I stopped waiting for replies, stopped expecting things, nothing interests me, and time just passes by. \nEverything just feels so unusual ever since. Like.. I just don\u2019t feel any strong emotions and I\u2019m neither happy or sad. Just something feels off and empty. \nI have everything I want in life, I just started attending the dream school I wanted to go to, people like me, I have a lot of friends, I\u2019m doing something I\u2019ve dreamt of, a good opportunity that I\u2019ve always wanted came to me a few days ago, and it just feels not that big you know? It\u2019s just like \u201cOh.. that\u2019s good. Ok\u201d and I\u2019m not feeling as happy as I thought. When I heard I got into the school, I was really happy but then it\u2019s just like, \u201c..Now what? The only goal that gave me motivation is now achieved. Was I just distracting myself the whole time?\u201d \nI tried giving myself goals, but nothing really motivates me, I tried looking for things I could do, and nothing interests me. I feel numb. \nI never truly feel connected to anyone in a group of people and it\u2019s so frustrating because I genuinely don\u2019t know why. I can make friends easily, and they all like me and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted. I make jokes around them, but honestly, I don\u2019t really feel anything when socializing with people. They all seem to enjoy the convo and they all seem happy and I just can\u2019t understand HOW they\u2019re happy. When we\u2019re all talking in a group I go along well with everyone, I laugh when they laugh, but I just feel incredibly alone and empty inside even when surrounded by people. \nI\u2019m jealous of other people, they all seem so happy and it makes me think, \u201cWhy do I think like this? Can\u2019t I just think like them and be happy? How do they believe that there\u2019s meaning in their life?\u201d When I see random people being happy with their life, I think \u201cWhat makes them so happy? Wish I were them.\u201d \nI started avoiding one of my close friends because she\u2019s really successful and when I\u2019m near her, I feel bad about myself. She\u2019s one of the sweetest person I\u2019ve ever met but when I\u2019m near her, it\u2019s like her positive energy just turns into negative for me. She\u2019s so enthusiastic and motivated that it makes me realize how miserable I actually am. \nI literally don\u2019t understand why I think like this. Is it because I have childhood trauma? Bullying? Parental problems? But why is it affecting me now? I don\u2019t wanna kill myself, because I won\u2019t be able to do it myself, I just don\u2019t wanna exist .

Years of being laughed at make me so scared just to make a post on social media.\nI don't know how to connect with others, so Ive tried to reach out online. But the internet is an awful place - I reached out for help about being abused after my mom died, and the top response was someone telling me to stop playing the victim. Nothing gives me joy. I have no hopes or dreams for myself.  I can't sleep. I can't cry.  There's this unreachable empty feeling in me.  \nMy family doesn't care, they just want money from me. Constantly, every week or so, a new request for a few hundred dollars, and the lie that I'll get it back. I watched my uncle point a gun at his daughter, and his son body slammed my cousin, and no one did anything. My aunt was raped and drunk herself to death, and all my family had to say was that she was a lying fool.  When she threw up blood in front of me after begging me to call an ambulance, no one actually looped around to check on her. And no one checked on me.  No one checked one me while my parents screamed at each other. No one cared when my mom died in front of me and I had to become a mom to my younger sibling. No one cared when my cheating father snuck off and married a random lady who to this day sees me as a rival for his love.  Instead I was blamed for my mom's death and asked why I let my dad do these things.\nI was a kid. I was a fucking child.\nAnd instead of recognizing that I'm traumatized and need a hug, people instead will shrug and label me as weird. My aunts will tell me to stop throwing pity parties and stop whining. That's all my family has ever done.\nAnd the country I live in?  Land of the free?  I'm seeing laws pile up that threaten my very existence. I can't go to the psychiatrist without going into debt. This country is awful.\nAnd no one cares. No one ever cares.  Every reddit post and throwaway I've made over the years. No response, not even an attempt to pretend to be concerned. I would hurt myself if I weren't scared of pain.",

 "text": "My mom's boyfriend is making me feel more and more miserable (this turned out to be a huge rant about everything) It's building up inside of me each day, I have to live with them every day of my life, and every day is the same, when he came to this house, my mom said it was a friend that had nowhere to stay and was gonna stay for some days, it's been 2 years, and I can't stand him, he thinks he knows it all, everything that I do, although not to my face, he mocks and talks about it, always complaining to my mom, and then she complains to me, never telling me it was him that complained but I hear them talking shit, he doesn't work, hasn't worked for like an year even though my mom has a huge debt, he's just a parasite living here like it's all his, I don't feel comfortable, I don't have my privacy.\nHe, sometimes, comes into my room and takes stuff whenever I'm at work, at first it was a doubt of mine, then I started to test it, and I was right, he sometimes takes money, cigs, weed, rolling papers, etc. all of that when I'm not home, without asking. And it's not like he's discret, because, even if it's the last of that thing that I have, he'll still take it, no warning, then I get home, I don't have this thing that I was looking forward to have, even though I'm sure I saved it for later.\nThis comes piling up for months now, I'm getting worse mentally each day, everyone at working is starting to despise me because I'm such in an angry mood all the time, even though I asked them for a lighter schedule because I was not in the right place mentally, this request was completely ignored, they kept giving me the worst shifts possible, their words being \"we can't give you lighter schedules because we need you here\", well, I sucked it up for months, letting it ruin even more my mental state, I asked them again for it, and they say I'm being lazy, that I don't want to work, that other people aren't complaining, etc. I tried to explain to them, without giving much information, because, tbh, they don't need to know, I tried to explain that it was for my mental health, that I started having anxiety attacks every day when I started to work those hours, even though I've never had anxiety attacks before, and I tried to ask them to not have me do those hours, it led to a big argument and them saying no.\nI just can't do anything, It's not that I don't want to do stuff, I just can't. Everyone shames me because I don't have my drivers license, and I've been postponing it for years, and that I'm being lazy, and I need to do this, or that, or I won't go anywhere in life, and that hurts, because I want to do those things, and I try to explain that I want to do those things, I just can't. I don't care that I won't go anywhere in life, because, right now, that's exactly what I want, to not go anywhere in life, I don't really want to die, but I feel like I wanna kms, it's not that I don't want to live at all, I just don't want to live this life.\nAlthough it only got worse these last couple years, I might be depressed since I was, like, 15, when my parents separated, and I never really thought about how much of a trauma it might have caused me, because I never talked about it, never even thought about it, I just completely erased it from my memory until recently when I started to think on everything. that's also when I started smoking and doing drugs, started doing bad in school and the only reason I even stayed at school was because of a girl that I really liked and a couple friends, I eventually left school without completing it, which I now regret and it's making me feel even more hopeless. When I left school, I started working, then I met my ex girlfriend from a friend at work, stayed with her for 2 years, might have been one of the happiest moments of my life, eventually, came covid, we lost our jobs, stayed at home together 24/7, it started go downhill where she'd get mad at me and then I'd start crying, she eventually got diagnosed with depression, started taking pills, she wasn't getting mad at everything but she said she felt numb with them, so she stopped taking them, I never gave my thoughts on this, since I didn't want to control her and I wanted her to deal with it how she felt she had to, even though it meant she being mad 24/7, I think it was somewhere around this time that she stopped loving me, I started feeling it, and it was eating me inside that I knew that the best thing that I had in life was going to leave, I was feeling it for months before it happened, and, stupid me, instead of trying to make things right, instead of trying to make her see why she loved me in the first place, I started feeling hopeless, I didn't do anything, then I'd get mad at myself for not doing anything, looking back, I could've done things way better, but oh well, a couple months go by, covid is \"safer\" now, she said she wanted to start going out with her friends again, and I was actually really happy about it and encouraged it, one day she left for a sleep over, I took her to the door, kissed her and said I loved her, she said she loved me too, then she goes 4 days without talking to me, no calls, no texts, nothing. She then texts me saying that she couldn't come back, that she can't keep doing it and she'd be here in some days to take all her stuff, that happened, I cried, she cried, we hugged, I begged her to stay, and then she left, I was destroyed, but deep down I was actually happy(?) for her, because she could find better. Fast forward 1 year (it was around this time that my mom's boyfriend came to the house), I have my job, I'm starting to feel a little bit better, my ex calls me, says that there's some stuff that she forgot and if I could bring it to her, which I said yes, went to meet her, gave her her stuff and she asked if I wanted to go smoke a joint and talk, because she wanted to talk to me, I accepted, we smoked, went for dinner, and then we were talking and that's when she said that she was hospitalized for 2 weeks and that was her second day out, and as soon as she got out, she wanted to call me and talk to me, she was hospitalized because she tried to kill herself, she overdosed but her mom found her in time and she could make it. When I heard that, I didn't say anything, I just didn't know what to say, and I'm not sure if that made her mad, but I just couldn't find the words.. she talked about it, although, while showing no reaction, I listened to everything she said and I still remember all the words she said. And that was it, we went our ways, as soon as I left, I started crying like I never did before, because, I was one of the big factors on her depression, and not a positive factor, and I'm responsible for it to leading to this, and I'm so glad that she didn't die, that haunts me to this day.. I wanted to stay friends, and she said she wanted to, but everytime I tried to make plans with her she'd push me away and she said that she can't actually be friends because it hurts her, so that's the last I've known of her, I know she's alive because of instagram and I talk to her dad frequently. \nThat's about it, I'm a mess, my mental health is a mess and this post is a mess, I just wrote everything that was piling up, and I'm so sorry if this is confusing, if you decide to read this, but, that's the best way I can put this..",

 "text": "Knowing there are treatments that will work might motivate a person. Some doctors don't try different types of meds, but there are 5 types of antidepressants, along with cognitive behavioral therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For severe cases, there is even electroconvulsive therapy, which works, but has possible undesirable side effects. The latter is not painful, as you're under sedation while it happens. I've never had it, but if nothing else worked, I might have tried it after a scary depressive episode when I was off my meds. Lesson learned: I needed them and very quickly after taking the meds again I was much better, but still had room for improvement. I just needed a different med added to what I was already taking, and then I felt what I think is normal.",

 "text": "Don't give up hope, because there is a treatment that will work for you. There are meds of various types like TCAs, SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, and tetracyclic antidepressants. There is talk therapy like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), and then there's TMS, or transcranial magnetic stimulation.\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-major-classes-of-antidepressants-1065086\nWhich works for you may be different from what works for me. I have treatment resistant depression. I was recently put on what some call California rocket fuel, or venlafaxine and mirtazapine together (two antidepressants that work differently) and have never felt better. I don't feel drugged like some say they feel when on an antidepressant, and I can enjoy things much more now than before. \nI went through TMS therapy and that certainly helped. But the change in antidepressants made more of a difference. \nIf you've lost the motivation to continue looking for a treatment that works because so many treatments just didn't work, don't give up. I didn't, and I FINALLY found what works for me, AFTER 67 years. (I've had depression my entire life.) I gave up trying for a long time and just put up with depression, but I tried TMS, and after that, the California rocket fuel combination, and I finally feel normal, able to really enjoy things in life. \nDon't give up, but don't wait decades to get the help you need, You may need a combination of things, like perhaps CBT and an antidepressant that works for YOU. Maybe you would do well with am MAOI (they're not first-line meds because you have to watch what you eat to avoid serious side effects, but they do almost always work). So there is hope. You just need to keep trying, like I did.",

I used to lie in bed at night, watch YouTube, keep myself from laughter so my parents wouldn't come in to my room and tell be to bed, nowadays I have to force myself to laugh. I can still have fun and actually laugh with my friends but those moments are slowly starting to dissappear. I keep telling myself that life will get better, I might meet a girl, maybe make some new friends but I'm starting to give up on that hope more and more now. So now I lie here in my bed, writing this and waiting for life to just end. I know there are so many people that have it worse than me and that I should be happy with all I have but it's just so hard to do. This isn't a cry for help or anything like that I just wanted to get this off my chest to just make it a little bit better but deep down I know it won't change anything.\nThanks for reading this I guess.",

 "text": "I am a wreck So first of all, i am NOT suicidal, but i i think of myself that i am pretty messed up.\nI  do have a severe depression that manifested in its current form three  years ago, shortly after my father passed away. I\u00b4ve been half-orphan  almost all my life, and i think i never recovered or healed from the  death of my mother. She passed away shortly after my 6th birthday due to  cancer. Until this day i have an extrem fear of seperation in terms of  relationships. On both romantic and non-romantic relationships, but it  is worse with romantic relationships.\nMy  father fucked up everything that was humanly possible. He basically  made sure that all his children are traumatized by his inability to be a  good father. I recently found out he never wanted children, but after  the first arrived, he didnt care anymore how many we would become. His  whole life revolved around his sexual desires, ranging from  crossdressing, bdsm even to zoophilia. We found out by accident in our  early teens, and we never talked about it until he kind of came out to  us about it a couple of years afterwards.\nHe  uprooted us on many occasions, first we moved from town to town, later  even changing the country, in an effort to hide from taxes and other  issues he created. On one occasion he took us out of school for 5 years.  We were able to make up for it by not beeing the dumbest kids, but  still, it never gave us any fundation. When we have been abroad, he  didnt live with us, he left us alone in \"our\" house while living with  his Girlfriend of that time. Our age ranged from 8-13 when this started,  it lastet for 6-7 more years.\nWhen  i became a young adult, i met this woman online. She lived in my  homecountry, and i managed to visit her for 3 month. During that time  she had an affair with me, since she was unhappy with her partner. The  intimacy i was able to experience with this woman was off the chart for  me. I fell in love deeply with her, and she seemed to reflect that. We  did spent alot of time together, long and deep talks. But all of a  sudden she tried to distance herself from me. She did spent new years  eve with her boyfriend, but soon after we managed to see each other  again and told me how much she loves me. unfortuneately i  had to get  back abroad since i had no place i could stay in anymore. She distanced  herself for some reason i dont understand until this day. I even met her  boyfriend of that time, i never understood why she risked so much for  me and stilled got rid of me so quickly.\nHalf  a year later i met my wife with whom i have a wonderful child. We are  together for more than 15 years, and i would call it a good marriage. I  love her, i would do everything for her, we plan our live together and  do so quite succesfully. Apart from a lack of sex, i cant say anything  bad about our relationship. We shared almost all our secrets with each  other, except for me who keeps this recuring feeling for that affair for  himself. I do have a healthy and smart child, my wifes wage is decent,  and my wage is almost double of the national average.\nAll  in all i should be happy, but i am not. I endure my life. Long before  my depression started i ate to much, its a coping mechanism. Since the  severe depression it got alot worse. I almost financially ruined us by  eating way more than we could afford. We are currently recovering from  that, but it is still a struggle for me. Our financial situation we have  been in, did not help my depression. But ut least this is getting  better now thanks to my well paid job.\nThe  only reason i am able to do my job is stress. I work for one of the  biggest carmanufacturers on this planet, i take care for some of their  essential IT stuff. This stress is the only thing making me work. At  home i feel like a total failure, unable to do some of the basic chores.  I always have to force myself to do basic stuff. My child and wife  being somewhat of a motivation, but still not enough to brake my  crippling depression. I am unable to sleep.  Everytime i go to bed, my  thoughts turn around the idea of me being worthless. They revolve around  my inability to be the best husband and father i  could be.\nThe  fact that the woman from my past keeps coming back into my mind nearly  every fucking night is getting the rest of me. I am unable to heal the  wound that was inflicted by her. Unable to fix my life. Unable to become  the husband and father my wife and child deserve. I am on the way of  becoming somewhat of a shadow of my father. Not being good enough for my  child, giving her the future she deserves. It always feels like i am  cheating my wife, even though i never talked to this woman of the past  since she broke me. Sometimes i would like to write her a message, ask  if she ever loved me, if she regrets letting me go. For my job i had to  go to the customer, the car manufacturer, this is on the other side of  my homecounry (i moved back 15 years ago when i met my wife). The woman  from my past lives near their headquarter, i felt so sick driving to  this customer. I was very close to the hometown of this woman during  that week. I felt like throwing up, it felt like the \"breakup\" just  happened. I had the urge to drive to her hometown and just have a look  at my memories, at what was my past.\nI am broken, i dont think i can be fixed.\nI  do have a therapist, but this is a long and painstaking process without  knowing if it will be successful. The least i can do is to endure my  life and make sure that my wife and my child have a better life. At  least thats what i am telling myself everyday. I take meds for my  depression, but all they do on a good day is to keep me neutral. My joy  of life is long gone.",

My therapist thinks my problem is I am not sufficiently \"organized\" and that I should get a maid. I have been through 5 therapists in multiple countries and I swear I must have crappy luck because they seem to all belong to the school of \"If you can work or even smile at the start of the session, then there's nothing wrong with you.

If a therapist tells you that they think you are severely depressed, will you feel better? \nIf you really are just going through the motions without really caring about what comes out of it, then you need to tell anyone who thinks you are okay, \"No, you're wrong.\" \nThe next time you reach out for therapy or mental health advice, you should let them know right away what you believe is going on in your head. \nThat was the only way I could get anyone to take my attention problems seriously. I sort of just dropped clues at first even though I was almost certain I had ADHD, and my parents and teachers said \"Just try harder to focus\" or some infuriating ignorant shit like that. I decided to schedule an appointment with a doctor letting them know right away that I think I have ADHD and I got prescribed with meds within a few weeks.",

Really all they ever did for me was write a little scribble on a piece of paper for me to give to the pharmacist, after I basically told them I have ADHD.\nTo give your therapists the benefit of the doubt, you could reflect your mental issues in way that they are not used to. They are probably under the impression that you aren't sure exactly what your problem is.\nIf you really need someone to recognize what you are going through and comfort you instead of a diagnosis, then trying opening up more with a close friend. I know you said you've told other about your negative thoughts, but I guess they didn't realize you where opening up and assumed you where complaining.\nI'm sorry if I'm not being helpful.",

About what other people would think, what you would say to each person and what your last words would be? I guess I am extremely sad with my life and sometimes think about that.

I think I wouldn\u2019t tell people about my imminent death. Not out of fear but because I wouldn\u2019t see any real purpose behind coming out with information like that. Why waste time and just see people change the way they treat you just because you\u2019re dying? Better off let that rest on your shoulders.

 "text": "I (16M) have been dealing with depression for years. And something's come up and I really need to talk about it. I've been depressed for years now. I was officially diagnosed around 3 years ago, but I've been showing signs for over 7. My main issue has always been just being lonely, which I know isn't uncommon but it's still something I've always had to deal with. Everything I've gone through, I've gone through alone with no help from anyone. And I'm tired of it.\nI've never had a girlfriend, or really even a best friend. I've had some friends that I could rely on. But I've never met that one person that puts me as a priority as well. Even though I know pretty much everyone else has that click with at least one other person.\nRecently, I've met this girl though. She's really nice to me for whatever reason, and in most ways she's just as broken as I am, if not more. Which is sad to say, but at least we can help each other. She admitted to me a few weeks ago that she had a crush on me, although it's a very complicated situation.\nShe already has a boyfriend. And he treats her like shit. He controls her, blackmails her, and even physically forces her to do what he wants. And she's not lying, I've seen it myself. She tells me that she's completely lost interest in him, and that she wants to be with me but she doesn't break up with him and I don't know why. She says she wants to, but she just doesn't. And I get that maybe it'll take time, but at the same time I don't know how to feel when I see them holding hands and cuddling.\nI'm not sure what to do. Because I really do have feelings for her, a lot of them. But at the same time, she's with another dude. And I've made it clear to her that her and I aren't a thing until she breaks it off with him and she understood. But she just won't choose and I'm not sure what to do. \nI'm just afraid. Because i know that my whole life I've had no one. And the first time I've finally found someone, it gives me at least a bit of hope. But I know that if I lose this it's going to be really bad for me. I just don't know what to do. Please someone give me some advice. Please.",

 "text": "2 big things, first is that you should talk to her about how bad mentally and physically it hurts her. She needs to feel safe enough to break up with him without being worried about him afterwards, but it is also very important that she does it in safe way to make sure he won\u2019t do anything to her.\nAnd for you specifically, and I mean this, never rely on someone enough that you have only known for even a few years, to much. Being to secure with someone that could stop talking to you, to far mentally down, etc can make things worse. It\u2019s hard especially when they are one of the few people that you have been close with to set boundaries (especially this early on) but trust me. You can do this :))",

Personally, if you can work up the resolve to cut her off completely and not end up crawling back in short order, I'd recommend doing that. Probably explain it a bit, that it's just not healthy for you, maybe it'll spur her to the right course of action. But you have to commit to it.

The thing is, constantly ever since a year and a half ago, they'd ignore me for weeks, sometimes even a couple months straight. They've always been very sweet to me whenever they weren't ignoring me, and I've always tried my best to give them the love they deserve. They said they like me too, and a couple days ago they told me they wanted to move in with me and that they love me, but just yesterday they announced that they had a crush on this person they met three days ago. We're not dating, but we'd been in that awkward phase for a long time where we're just friends but we acted like a couple. I tried asking them out a year ago but they rejected me, and since then I've been waiting for them to make the move. Since then, they've been ignoring me more and more, and I've tried talking to them about it millions of times, they apologize, and then do the same thing again. So I tried to move on, and they know it too, because I gave them everything and that wasn't good enough to make them talk to me, and I didn't wanna pressure them. However, I can't move on, and I love them too much, but after their recent announcement, I just feel shocked that I'm the person whose given so much to be with them, trying my best to treat them the way they deserve, and also apologizing when I realize I was wrong, but they choose somebody they met three days ago. I feel like I want to die, they've been the only person there for me all these years, and now I may lose them.\nI feel like it's wrong for me to feel this way, because I'm trying to move on, why can't they?

 "text": "How can you figure out what's wrong with you if you can't even do basic things to get to the places or people that will help you? I'm 22, almost 23 now. Been suffering something pretty bad mentally since around 2019, and it's just been getting worse and worse.\nI don't feel comfortable around my family. I can't tell them anything about me, never felt like I could. My parents would always give me the \"You can come to us whenever you don't feel okay\", but whenever I would, I'd get a lecture along the lines of \"Seriously? Do you have any idea of how Me and your other parent feel? Working 40 hours of week, cooking dinner, cleaning, taking care of 8 kids, and paying off this house? What could You possibly have to be Sad about?\" So I gave up trying to confide in my parents, let alone my family. My brothers were the only ones I was able to really hang a round as a kid, and they treated me like shit. (I don't really entirely blame them, I was a fucking stupid and obnoxious kid who was really inconsiderate. Still though, it didn't help that confiding my feelings was seen as \"Gay\" or \"F*ggy\" to them, and they'd push me around for \"acting like a girl\". They're nicer these days, but the damage is done already. You know?) My sisters weren't too terrible to me as a kid. They were pretty generally polite to me most of the time, but they had their moments where they could be pretty harsh, and even mean. But definitely no where near as bad as my brothers. My late oldest brother never did anything bad to me as a kid and has always been a good older brother, and a good role model. My other brothers were Really bad, though. There's a lot of extremely deep-routed trauma here, but I won't go into that right now..  \nThey was the stuff I really dealt with as a kid. As an adult, my parents are constantly pressuring me to find a career to stick to that makes good money, and to buy my own car and move out. They've been on me about it since I was 16. I still don't have my license. I have really bad nightmares and anxiety about driving, I'm terrified of dying or killing someone else in a car accident, damaging my parents or someone elses cars/property, etc. Lately getting some driving practice in has alleviated a bit of that anxiety, but I haven't been able to practice driving in a Long while, so the anxiety is starting to come back quite a bit, and I have No confidence in taking a driving test anymore, so I plan to ask my friend to help me learn to drive. The only problem is that he works overtime practically every week, and I feel bad to take him away from his super rare days off, even though I know he'd set aside a day just for me, like the angel he is.\nMy biggest problem (among many) is that I have a Really hard time asking others for help. I think it comes down to trust, but only to some extent. The aforementioned friend is someone I trust with everything, but I think my reluctance with him is that I don't wanna inconvenience him on his rare off-time. With my family, I just don't trust them, I feel Extremely uncomfortable around them, and I don't like hanging out with them. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, I do, it's really hard to be saying all this about them, but it's true. I don't like being around them, I don't feel like I can be myself, truly. I don't feel like they like me and only try to get me to hang with them out of obligation, and because I isolate myself in my room 24/7. They always say the same shit whenever they have a get together and I spend most of my time in my room. \"We missed you today, don't you like hanging out with us?\" or in the chance I appear downstairs with them, they try to drag me into their convos or beg me to hang out, or even guilt trip me into it. But what's annoying is, even if I do, they don't ever try to really include me or value my opinion on anything. They always wanna do things I'm not interested in, and they'll think I'm selfish for wanting to do my own thing instead of forcing myself to do something I don't enjoy in order to spend time with them.\nMy mom reluctantly let our dad give me and my brother our own PC in our room. (He is a super tech-guy. Has worked at a tech company for practically my whole life, is super into testing new gaming shit like consoles, peripherals, PC parts, tech in general. He's always made somewhat decent money, so me and my family were fairly fortunate enough to have a lot of PCs and consoles for gaming and school, so I can't really complain there. He was always very absent when I was a kid cause he worked a lot. I held him in high regards when I was younger cause for the most part, he's always been a nice guy. As of late though, I've discovered some unfortunately bigoted things about him. Him joining in on pressuring me hasn't helped my opinion of him, either.) Eventually, when we were teens, my brother and I got our own PCs, but only He could have his in our room, mine had to stay out in the loft, where Everyone could see and hear me. It was scary and I had No privacy, ever. And despite he and I being in the same age range, my moms excuse at the time was \"He's older\", but even when I reached his age, I still couldn't move my pc into there. Eventually she finally told me \"If I let you move your pc into your room, me and your siblings will Never see you.\" Which, yes, was, and still is true. It still Frustrates me that she still hasn't ever stopped to think about just why that is, exactly. It's like she thinks that I'm just being unreasonable, and a bad person by wanting to get away from them.. They just can't see how they're pushing me away until I break and finally say something. But I know if I do, it's just gonna make things SO Much harder for me, even more than they already are.\nBut eventually, she finally let me move my PC into my room. I still had no privacy cause I shared my room with my brother, and he had just started dating a girl (Who's now his wife), and they constantly wrestled and screamed and fucked in the room while I was in there. It was awkward and embarrassing to have to be around it, but I always tried my best to just isolate myself to my PC and ignore them with Music and Games. (This is funny btw, cause I was Never allowed to have Any girls in my room, but he was. She feigned shock when I told her about what they did while I was in the room. God it seriously fucking pisses me off how comically differently she treated me and my brother.)\nMy brother moved a few years ago and I finally have a bit of privacy these days, and god, even this teeny, Tiny bit of privacy is so heavenly. I don't have to be around any of them, talk to any of them, or worry about them seeing what I'm doing. (I gotta be careful with my volume and what I say tho, I have an EXTREMELY loud voice that carries way too easily, so even if my door is closed, people can still hear me a lot of the time if I'm not careful.)\nLately, I've discovered myself quite a lot while spending time with friends, or even just spending time by myself. In 2018 I discovered that I was attracted to other men, and in general felt a lot more feminine. In 2021, I started to feel like I might want to transition, but only ever just thought about it. Over that year, I built up the courage to confide in my friends about what I was thinking and feeling. They were all very supportive, and encouraging. In 2022, I got Super drunk around my friends, and basically told them how Badly I really wanted to be a girl. How I had even thought of what name I'd go by, the clothes I had bought to wear, the kind of stuff I'd make about it, etc. It was super out of nowhere, but again, they were super nice, and supportive about it. The next day when I was sober, they talked to me about it, and it gave me the courage to finally go through with it. I identify as a trans woman, and I plan to go through with transitioning when I move out this year. I wanna do it as soon as I possibly can, but I absolutely can Not while I live in this house with my parents. I have no idea how they'd react, but based on some things they've expressed in the past, I don't think it would end well..  \nAs of late, I've been absolutely Aching to escape. I seriously Never leave my room now, unless it's for the bathroom, work, or food. That's it. I really feel out of place, and like I don't belong around my family. I feel like my autism, adhd, and ptsd have gotten Really bad. Almost everything bothers and sets me off, and a Lot of shit just randomly triggers really bad, painful, or uncomfortable memories. It's gotten to a point where I start to feel a ton of anxiety, and like I'm generally overwhelmed around them. It's really bad, and I just wanna get out of here so I can be the person I desperately want to be. It's not going to just magically make me happy with life or anything, but it will make me comfortable. Comfortable with myself, and just generally comfortable living my life. And that's all I want.  \nI can't drive, my friend who can is Super mega busy all the time, and I Really want to get help. Mental help, especially. I need to get out of this house, and I feel like the mental issues I'm dealing with right now are a Huge reason as to why I haven't been able to do a Lot of the things I Need to do, like learning to drive, getting a car, etc. The SUPER Rare times I've built up the courage to subtly confess to my mom that I wanna get tested for Autism or Depression, she Always finds a way to downplay it, or change the subject. She doesn't want to accept that there's something wrong with me. That or she just doesn't want to help me unless it's an immediate medical emergency, or work. I need to get help and diagnosed, because I feel like it might help me Finally do the things I NEED to do to live on my own. I just, don't possibly know how I can. I'm lost, and I'm scared.",

My job usually has me pretty isolated. It's rare that I'm around people let alone anyone I would have anything in common with. Social media and dating apps provide no results. I hate bars and clubs. I mostly just work now. I can fake it... With social interactions but I don't really find myself in those anymore. I noticed the rules changing in my 20s. You couldn't just talk to strangers anymore. Now it's almost taboo to just walk up and start a conversation. I've had some time off lately, 2 weeks here and 2 weeks there. I can't stay in a book, a show, a movie, a game, I have no interest in my guitar or music stuff, I have other things I've picked up and put down. I recently noticed since I've been off work that a few hours or so after waking up and starting my day I have an overwhelming wave of exhaustion come over me. Yesterday I let it take me but I only napped maybe an hour if that. Whether or not I nap I still have to do a ritual to get to sleep. Tea, melatonin, zzzquil, neck pillow, eye mask, ear plugs, the works. When I'm off I'm located in a small TX Town. I'm not from here. I don't really know anyone and people are really weird. I have no viable way to make any acquaintances or friends. Maybe this is it? I am 37. My parents never had much in the way of a social life, but they did have each other, me and my siblings and the rest of the family. I literally have no one aside from a few relatives and old contacts, all of which are pretty toxic people. This comes and goes but it's been a lot more intense lately. Maybe I'm just not distracted enough? Maybe I just need to go back to work? I have this mindset of making up for lost time because I had a pretty shitty start at life. Am I a workaholic? I've heard the word thrown around but I've never really been sure if it applies to me or not. I go to the gym when I can, I try to do things out in the yard and on a ranch property nearby just to... Idk honestly. I just do it. I haven't had sex in over a year and honestly I wasn't satisfied with my last encounter and she was just kind of not a likeable person. I played the game and got in. That's the other part when it comes to the opposite sex... I have the capacity to play the games but I've grown really tired of them. With people in general it's not often that you can be genuine, with women especially. I'm not sure what I hope to learn by posting here. I thought it may be a good idea. I'm open to some advice. No I don't have suicidal thoughts or anything like that at all... I'm too stubborn for any of that. Thanks in advance.",

Aa you grow older, you lose more and more until one day you die and leave everything behind. Until then we try to forget reality as best we can and delude ourselves. We try to fill a void with anything we can but only end up on a wheel going round and round and round. If you ask me, society itself is mentally ill. They just don't know it because its the norm. We're so used to the madness that we no longer see it clearly for what it is.\nSo don't feel too bad when your telling yourself that your messed up. The whole world is fucked. People are uncaring and lacking basic human qualities. The leaders are cruel, good people are suffering, animals and people are being harmed greatly etc...\nI despise the evil in this world and always will. I hope hell is real.

It\u2019s tiring but finding ways to cope can really help, and a significant portion of people who do even experiences remission, at least for a time. \nIn the mean time, I just see it like this: some people have a physical disability that means they, for instance, can\u2019t walk. They\u2019ll miss out on things normal people who can walk do, things that are deemed necessary, things that bring joy. But they get used to it and find ways around it to survive anyway. \nHaving a mental illness just means your life is limited, but it doesn\u2019t have to be over. Seek treatment before you give up, in the mean time take what you can. Sometimes if I haven\u2019t slept or if I can actually get out of bed I go for a walk in the park and buy a nice drink from the coffee shop. It doesn\u2019t make me happy the way it used to, but the park is pretty, the coffee tastes nice, the music in my headphones sounds good. It makes me feel almost content, if not happy. You won\u2019t necessarily always feel sad, you just might not feel happy. Sometimes accepting that\u2019s how it is for now is the best you\u2019ll get.",

I don't remember what it's like to feel happy. It doesn't help that I can't actually focus on something useful due to ADHD. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, but my parents think I \"grew out of it\" which is literally impossible. They refuse to believe me. No game is enjoyable anymore. It all just becomes insanely repetitive. The same thing over and over. And I'm in no position to get a new game. Any free one completely sucks. Even the good games are completely uninteresting. My home life completely sucks. My dad being the main cause. It's stressful just being near him. I brought it up near him once, hoping to talk about a solution, but I couldn't even finish my sentence before he pinned me to a corner. Eventually he let me go, and I felt the urge to escape from him. So I barricaded myself in my room. Eventually things calmed down, and we talked it out. And things got all better. Heh. I wish. He didn't get any better. Sure, he got less physical, but every other aspect got twice as bad. Now, if I'm late to the bus, even by a second, I lose internet for 24 hours and it doubles each time. I wanted to forgive him all those days ago. I wanted to feel positively towards him. Now the only feeling left is intense animosity. School is extremely busy. I'm talking computer science, precalc, US history, and chemistry. And all my teachers LOVE assigning large projects at the same time. And frequently too. As if they are the only class I have. It's so much that I can't get myself to do any of it. I am incapable of looking at the smaller picture and focusing on one chunk at a time. I think about any part of it and I practically shut down. I don't feel like there's any path forward. Just downward. And I'm hitting every branch on my way down. But I don't have a way to reach out. No close friends to talk to. No family that I can actually share my issues with (the last one I could share with fucking DIED). This hole is only sinking deeper. And eventually, it's going to collapse. I need a way out of the hole before that. Yet, to escape would mean putting my family in another one. I don't know how I can proceed.",

I have no passions of any kind, all the things that I loved before do not interest me anymore. I'm 22 and never been in a relationship. Never have I achieved anything in my life. Never have I made anyone proud of me. I don't think I will be able to ever make anyone proud of me. No matter how hard I try I can't improve myself. I am a massive disappointment to my parents, I never could give them what a son should, I never made them feel what a son should. I am a fking failure and I don't think this will ever change. My months of effort amount to nothing. Other people put half the effort and get rewarded 100x more. I envy everyone. What's the point of living if nothing ever excites you to wake up in the morning. What is the point of living if nothing makes you genuinely happy anymore. Nobody gives two fucks about me. All my friends despite knowing I am depressed never try to talk to me. The only people who will be sad if I ever die would be my family, but atleast that would prevent them from being disappointed every day if I continued living. i don't seem to change no matter how much effort I put in to improve. Perhaps, some people are born to be a failure and unfortunately I am one of them.",

 "text": "Since I don't know how much time you're willing to put into tons of information I can feed you.. I'll say this:\nPanic and stress are caused whenever you're feeling like you've lost control. If you've lost control then what can be done? Nothing. We're stressed, unsure of what to do, and give it enough time and it'll get into a panic attack where you feel trapped and possibly freeze. You've probably felt that at least once in your life. So the principle so to speak over panic/stress is hopefully clear.\nNow whenever you're feeling in control, generally your life will be less stressed. Now in terms of how it should be done - you've gotta know how to trust yourself in that area. Am I good at figuring out solutions? What's the worst that could happen in X situation, would I be lost? Or it'll feel uncomfortable and pass after a couple minutes? (If you've got specific cases lemme know and I'll try to hlep with it).\nProcessing traumas is tough, again I'm unsure how much you're willing to read all I've to say.\nI'll say this:\nAbout your mom  -do you feel anger towards her? Unforgiveness? If so with that I can definitely help, but it'll take time. With time you'll heal. I don't claim to have every answer to your situation, but whatever I can help with that I've dealt in my past and got out of I'll do my best to help you.

 "text": "The only way I can explain it is like this: It's like having an unbearable back pain. You change the mattress, work on your posture, stretch, soak with Epsom salt, but the pain is always there. There's no reason why anything should hurt so you go to the Dr who puts you through all the possible testing, scans, ultrasound, x-rays, and there is no logical or scientific explanation for the pain you're feeling. But it's there, it exists, it's crippling, and it's starting to paralyze you. No medication or physical therapy can bring comfort. It takes the joy out of your life, the taste away from the food, it numbs your skin, it clouds your vision, the only thing you can do is be in bed and sleep. Sleep makes you forget about the pain for a bit. At this point you're tired and sore and the only thing that can make it all stop, is death. But the guilt you feel for wanting to die is almost as bad as the invisible back pain itself.\nI can't really help you... I can barely help myself, but I can tell you what has given me some comfort: make sure that she has food, and drinks enough water, and sleeps in a clean bed. Offer her fresh clothes, help her shower, or take a bath. Hand her the toothbrush with toothpaste. Sometimes you may have to literally take her to the tub, and soap her up. For those days when that's too much, find compromises, dry shampoo, mouthwash, and baby wipes will do.\nYou can only help her survive this.",

It's hard for me to definitely separate depression from anxiety, as someone who has experienced both for as long as I can remember.\nI'd say the anxiety is the feeling of dread and the depression is the inability to imagine things can actually become better?",

 "text": "i have never achieve anything Starting this year, my mood is kinda off,  I have way more suicidal thoughts than I have in a lifetime. I am currently 23 years old, never had a job, I did somewhat okay with schools, but I never realised I don\u2019t have any specialities, talents that could wow people. I just graduated with a bachelor degree September last year. My goal was to jumpstart my career, but my family wanted me to further studies, get a master\u2019s degree. So, I promise my dad I\u2019ll secure a job first, then I\u2019ll do my coursework part time. It has been 6 months and I couldnt get anywhere, I see all my friends have already gotten theirs, while I\u2019m just stuck. And that has taken a token on my mental health, everyday I felt like crap and there is something wrong me. Every night before I go to bed, I\u2019m thinking that all of my accomplishments are influenced by others, but as a whole person, I can\u2019t function. I kept imagine my life just slipping away, still sitting with my parents, jobless, and will die alone. And that idea alone made me so eager to just end it all.",

I started down one day on 5mg and one day off as my next method of tapering. However, I've noticed that after about 3 weeks of this regiment, I start having depression again and have to start dosing everyday.

Im 20 and this will be my first home away from family. \nMy problem: actually packing to leave. In the past the only time I\u2019ve ever had to pack was during traumatic experiences. Being ripped from my childhood home, being kicked to the streets by my bio mother, and having to move in from the streets with my bio father. So, just packing up my tiny room of junk at my dads house feels like I\u2019m about to enter another round of horrible trauma. It\u2019s not a lot of stuff, but every time I start packing tears start falling and I end up spiraling. I\u2019ve been procrastinating it. \nAt this point, I\u2019m going to have to smoke a lot of weed and just start throwing things in trash bags because it\u2019s easier than actually boxing them and it gets it done faster. But the thing with that is, I\u2019ve only ever moved in trash bags. This is my chance to actually have a proper move instead of being given the old foster system carrier. \nI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t share this with anyone because everyone thinks I\u2019m so excited to be out on my own. And obviously my living situation isn\u2019t the safest. My dad and his family are all out on vacation right now without me and I\u2019m meant to be getting my shit ready to be taken to my apartment. My bio sister is taking me out tomorrow and I might try to talk to her, but we haven\u2019t talked much since we got separated. \nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really know what to do with myself.",

Trying to bottle my emotions lately has been impossible and it feels like everyone is looking at me as \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d. I\u2019m FUCKIN emotionally drained and exhausted. The slightest things will send me crying. I can\u2019t emotionally handle life at the moment. I feel like I\u2019m in a constant gray. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling this way too. :(",
