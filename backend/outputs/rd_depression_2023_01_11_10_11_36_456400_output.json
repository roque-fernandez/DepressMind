 "text": "hello, just need a place to dump. I'm turning 27 next months, and aside from university, i've got absolutely nothing to show for in my life. i don't have any friends, i've never been able to stick with any hobbies, and even though i was exercising well for the last year or so, i've hit a completely brick will with my energy levels and i can't even bring myself to go for a short walk these days. i'm stuck living at home with my parents at the moment, and whilst well-meaning, are completely awful at any emotional support, and usually just end up berating me for 'thinking too emotionally' when i try to open up about anything, and usually don't accept any perspectives of what they think is correct. i'm so withdrawn from the world, and i can't even be truly present and focus on conversations at moment for some reason. \ni'm also leaving the country and moving to canada in six weeks, and now i'm terrified that i'm just gonna eat concrete and fuck everything up the second i get off the plane because i'm arriving with such awful mental health. how the hell am i supposed to make friends and settle in a new country when i think of myself as such a failure that even basic conversations seem like a struggle right now. this should be the opportunity of a lifetime but now it feels like it's the only option i have to get away from a world where i've just fucked about for 26 years with nothing to show. at least when i'm in canada i have the excuse of being new as to explain why i have no friends.\nit seems like even when things should be getting better, i'm not. at this point i'm just damaged goods",

 "text": "I'm so conflicted on how to feel about myself. I genuinely wish that i was never born, and wish that i would just cease to exist so that i could die without anyone that did care about me, to not have to worry about me. i feel so stressed about everything, from my study path to my career of choice, and yet i have just barely become a legal adult. \nit feels like there\u2019s no where for me to turn to, nobody for me to talk to. the last time i felt safe enough to open up and talk to someone who i considered a close friend, someone who i had genuinely loved, later told me that opening to her was triggering for her, and when we broke up, told me she wasn\u2019t satisfied with my answer of \u201cgiving myself time and space for my mental health\u201d. \ni don\u2019t know how to approach things anymore, i feel like i\u2019ve just\u2026.become dumber. more stupider. i lack the same awareness that my peers have, feeling like a shell every single day i go to class. yet at the same time, i feel obligated to go. and when i did end up making new friends, i feel like i fucked it all up, saying things i don\u2019t realize are insensitive or just not realizing that some things just shouldn\u2019t be said at all. i feel guilty for some things i\u2019ve done, or some things i\u2019ve said, but i get too scared to talk to them about it and apologize, because i convince myself that they\u2019ll just hate me even more. \nyet whenever i attempt to make friends, it feels like it starts off ok but as time goes on, i just end up never replying. not because i hate them, but just that it\u2019s so\u2026.hard. it\u2019s so hard to tell people that because i\u2019m depressed, just sending a reply to someone is hard. \nit all feels so debilitating. i have no motivation to work, or draw, or improve myself. my vocabulary becomes more limited, my skills are deteriorating rather than improving, i have no more passion for everything. it feels like i\u2019ve messed up being a friend, a girlfriend, a sister, a daughter, everything. i end up shunning myself and cause others to shun me as well. \ni wish that i could just die. it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a point to continue living. i daydream about ways to die, from natural disasters or man-made accidents, to just actively killing myself. \ni didn\u2019t really feel like writing this much, but why not since it feels like another bout of insomnia is coming up? even if i could have written this in a journal to myself, i just wanted to put something out there into a void of sorts without the pressure of friends knowing and so that i can at least get the small speck of relief that someone can read this without messaging or interacting with me.",

Yet I can\u2019t find the strength to even do laundry, let alone leave. I can\u2019t set boundaries. I would rather suffer in silence than hurt someone I love or even someone I don\u2019t even know. I accepted a new position at a job I have no experience doing and part of the job is being assertive and I just can\u2019t do it. I sit in my office 8 hours a day just staring into oblivion. I get home and can do nothing more than sit in the clutter I scream at myself to clean, but I feel like a plant on the couch and can\u2019t find even a shred of motivation to clean up. I don\u2019t know what it will take to fix it. I don\u2019t know how to change and I feel like I\u2019m watching my best years pass me and it\u2019s the most exhausting, hollowing feeling. I\u2019m missing out on experiences and life because my depression is swallowing me whole. I\u2019ve googled hundreds of ways to fix it, or make myself feel better by releasing some chemicals in my brain, but can\u2019t bring myself to do anything but sit and cry and wish I was better. I hope I can get better.",

 "text": "I'm so depressed today I couldnt eat. I called in sick to work and laid in the floor. I went for a walk and drank tons of black coffee and found ways to hate on everything I saw. I walked in the cold until I couldn't feel my feet and kept walking until hunger and cold made me feel like I was going faint. I wanted to pass out and just lay there until my body froze. I made it home and laid on the floor again and fell asleep. I finally ate. I wanted to make it 24 hours without eating for some reason but didn't quite make it.\nI have a wife and kids and I've been their solid ground for so long. For a decade I put them first but it eroded my own sense of self or something. As the kids got older their emotional needs grew, so did my wife's. My resposibilities and pressures just grew and continue to grow with no end in sight. I started smoking pot constantly. We had a handful of various small family \"stresses\" about money and physical health and the emotional bottom of the whole thing just fell out. I had a horrible row with my wife. Now I'm in freefall. I threw away all my pot a couple of days ago. It felt like a productive way to hurt myself. It was like my best buddy and I killed it. Good! I hate it.\nNow I'm here on the floor writing this. I feel like I'm on the bottom of an aquarium, like a dying piece of coral. I'm not asking for help. I don't care if anyone reads this. I just needed to write it.",

Right now I'm not even sad, I'm not indifferent, I'm just here?  Not the nice, nirvana, everpresent here, I'm sitting here on my bed.  Okay, so... but why?  Why am I here?  Why do I exist?  I know I have to figure out the answer myself but either I'm too dumb to do it, too scared to do it, or I'm already living the answer, I guess.  \nI feel like... no one truly understands me and I've given up trying to connect with others because it doesn't work out.  I feel like I've tried so hard and for what?  For nothing, really.  And I know the common denominator is me, I know it.  And I know I'm not the easiest person to deal with, but I don't think I'm the worst person either. \nI know my negativity eats me alive, steals my time, steals my quality of life.  My negativity just permeates through me.  I was driving yesterday thinking like... I feel like I waded through wet concrete and stopped and now it's dried and I'm stuck and I feel like part of the concrete.  I feel like someone/something poured concrete in me and I can't move, therefore, I don't know what the point is.  I'm here but I can't do anything.  I can't will myself to do anything because there is no point.  I type on here because I can't talk about this with anyone.  \nI wish I knew why I'm here.  I wish I knew if I was good.  I don't feel like a good person.  I don't think I am a good person.  I carry a lot of negative thoughts about people.  I'm so judgmental of other people.  I'm so angry at people.  I'm so sad at people.  I feel dumb.  I feel unattractive.  I feel juvenile.  I feel blank.\nWhy am I here?  I feel like I'm blowing it.  I feel like I'm wasting time with whatever it is I'm supposed to be doing here.  I'm not good at life.",

I cry a couple times a day, except when I can feel nothing.
