With an attitude like that\u2026all I can offer you is good luck. \nJust adding, you have no idea what my story is like, how many \u201crelationships\u201d I\u2019ve had and how many times I\u2019ve also been rejected with the exact same rejections you listed. You are not the only one to go through this shit. What makes us different is our attitude towards the situation. \nBeing smart, does not make you mature. Give yourself some time, mature a little more, then you will see the \u201cbig picture\u201d and realize that sex is not some huge thing you need to strive for. \nAgain. Good luck.",

As a designer, the lighting in the picture matters a lot and you\u2019ve been able to match the lighting close enough that it won\u2019t be blatantly obvious to non-designers! Good job.",
