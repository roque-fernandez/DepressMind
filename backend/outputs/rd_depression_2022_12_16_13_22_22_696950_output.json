I hope I get so drunk I choke in my sleep and never have to wake up into this fucking shit world again.\nNot like anyone's gonna read this or even give a fuck. We're all just screaming into the void.",

Like a lost cause . I\u2019ve been a lighting rod for anger for so long I\u2019ve felt cold and I\u2019ve felt heartless and that leads me nowhere so I\u2019m hoping this will help .",

Credit card debt,  medical, have no job to even pay rent. \nMy apartment is barely even 10 ft by 30 ft any way. \nMy dreams are dead. All of them. \nI am a millenial and just waking up is so hard. Just getting out of bed is so so so very unrewarding. \nWant to sleep forever honestly. \nIt's supposed to be christmas and I'm getting a vaccuum cleaner and nothing else. I just really am happy I am checking in in the morning. Bc I'm being made to wake up.\nWhat for?",

Money is always a problem, I feel like I'm constantly wrecking my relationships and pushing people away, which enables straight up loneliness\nWorking too many hours but it is never paying off because in every part of my life I'm just trying to make up ground and get back to 0. I've been negative for so long I'm so comfortable being negative, even being at 0 would be a breath of fresh air right now. Makes it hard to get up in the morning, really",
