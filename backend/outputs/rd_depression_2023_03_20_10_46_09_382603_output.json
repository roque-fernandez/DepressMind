 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

Too ashamed to look at any of my professors, I feel like I'm just too much of a pain to deal with. Really pushed and planned for going back tomorrow no matter what I feel, but a professor emailed me and I think they think I cheated on my midterm. I didn't, but if it's taken as a cheated paper I might get expelled, and I think that might just be the thing that does it for me. I hate that every thought is \"suicide\", I hate that I feel like I'm faking my depression, and I feel terrible just for posting all of this, but there's no point not to, I guess. I don't know what I'm reaching for here.",

I didn't reply.\nNow she's married and im depressed, alone, and lost. \nI should have told her that we should have made it work even despite the distance, spwcially after I found out that she now married someone that she had also met long distance. So clearly she would have been okay making long-distance work.\nI missed out on the one girl who really loved me, and I really loved.

Now I am just focused on trying to get out of that survival mode mindset because i don't need it anymore and as anything that doesn't serve a purpose for me I try to remove it.\nTrying to make friends, meet a partner and build a life that I can be proud of is hard work but for me it's just necessity now!",

My weight, my looks, the fact I am ignorant to many things. It's something that rarely bothers me. I've came to terms with it after all these years. Plus it's a weird coping mechanism I guess.\nI was talking to a friend of mine in the break room when a co-worker walks in and tells her that she looks beautiful. I go in to make a self deprecating joke like \"hey aren't I beautiful too?\"  The look she gave me and the hesitation to say anything sure left an impression. Funnily enough if she said \"not really\" I could've easily played off that. But to say nothing impacted me more than anything. It's been a few months since anything has put me down easily. I haven't been overthinking and getting into my head as easily. I haven't cut myself since January. But damn. That kinda hit deep. To be fair I was asking for it I suppose.

There are usually services and/or programs that people facing homelessness and other serious hardships can access. It wont be immediate, but the people working at these resources and programs should be able to help set you up atleast with a framework or plan of what you can do next to get things back on track. If you cant find anything immediately, dont give up. Keep searching. Unless you live in the sticks, most cities have something in place Ask LOTS of questions, programs or services to help with paying for any medications, food stamps, or anything. Take advantage of any program/service you qualify for that can help you. And avoid instant cash loans. They are basically debt traps and will fuck you with extremely high intrest rates. You may also want to look into applying for unemployment. Dont give up hope! I hope this was at least a little helpful!!",

I start to tear up but my mind and body shuts down all my emotions and I can't cry. I want to cry so bad, to just let it out and feel something real again, but I just grow numb immediately. I feel the build up, my eyes start stinging and then out of nowhere, nothing. I feel nothing. I physically can't cry anymore. Last time I felt like I was having a break down I just started to laugh hysterically and just had this huge grin on my face until I grew numb again. I don't know what's wrong with me. Am I the only one ?\nI lost track of time, a whole year has passed in the blink of an eye and nothing has changed. All the suicide jokes I made to myself have slowly developed into real dark urges. \nI can't kill myself and leave my friends and family to pick up the pieces. So I'm forced to be hopeful though. I was happy 3 years before grief struck, I know I can be happy again. I'm a suicidal optimist, which is extremely goofy.",

Especially with the pressure you are facing it seems reasonable for your brain to be a bit drained. \nAlso Try to self reflect upon the aspects that build the circumstances you are facing right now. Since depression often is so overwhelming were forced to see everything Grey scaled and drawing connections between moods and mental illness becomes alot harder. For example what exactly is bothering you about your job? Is it something about the job itself (Form of Labor, Customer Comment ect.) or something mental illness related (A situation accured that triggered your mental illness).",

When i was in hs i used to self harm, and when my mom found out i stopped out of embarrassment. i've relapsed once or twice, but recently i've had this crippling feeling of lonliness and sadness. I can hardly get out of bed to use the washroom or eat, even when i do get out of bed things like eating just aren't important to me or just feels like too much work. I can't do my school work, my body and braid just won't allow it, and this causes more sadness because of the anxiety of failing school and being worthless. Life just feels very heavy and i hate who i am, i don't feel like i have a future. I have no goals or real accomplishments and the friends that i have i just don't think are my people, i feel like i don't have anyone. I've never been able to talk to anyone about this because first of all i don't think anyone really hears or listens to me, and second its embarrassing. I hate the feeling of people feeling bad for me, so i suffer in silence. I've done this my whole life. How are some people just okay and happy with their lives? how do i get there? i feel like there will always be something or i'll always hate myself and suffer alone,.",

I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend and the guys I have tried to date end up being sleazy. I just want to be a homemaker and this college life isn\u2019t for me.

I live out of state and my mom refuses to help drive my things over so I can only brings stuff by airplane. I don\u2019t play piano anymore, I don\u2019t cook or bake which are things that make me really happy. \nI know someone is going to call me lazy but I swear that isn\u2019t the case.

When I look at myself I see that I, don't have a job, horrible in public settings and pretty much spend most the time I talk to him feeling envious of him. I'm a loser who doesn't really have a life to look forward too. I can tell my friend has developed over the past 3 years as well. We are both 21 but it feels very obvious that he has a more adult life. The way he talks to people is normal and he can start conversations with others well. While with me it's kinda just me being an awkward loser who tries to be funny. So my question to you all is. Should I just start slowly ghosting him so he can get me out of his life. I feel like I'm only holding him backhes made it clear that he hates people like me (not me specificall but how he described it, was basically like me) he's my only friend and I know ill be pretty lonely but should I?

 "text": "I'm not in a good headspace. Life in general. I've been through so much bullshit people don't even believe me anymore. My father abused my mom, and when she ran away, he started beating me. I told the schools when I was six, and they just turned around and told my dad everything I said. He told them I have a vivid imagination, and then proceeded to chuck me off of the roof of our house when, keep in mind, I was six years old. He hit me in the head with a metal bat when I was nine, shot me with a BB gun, tried to stab me, hit me in the head with beer bottles, and coming home from school to see him slouched over with a bottle of pills in his hand thinking he was dead wasn't fun either.\nUltimately became homeless at 12 and worked at a McDonald's on night shift when I did school during the day from 12-18, then stayed at McDonald's until the beginning of 2020 when I finally got a tax job. I could never go to homeless shelters because if the cops find you, they just drop you off at that the border of another state (I won't say which ones). I've seen it to many people I knew during my time on the street.\nNow I'm finally away from the worst parts of my life, but the trauma is even worse. I can't sleep. I can barely breathe. I have heart problems and I'm sure I'm just one bad day away from going into a mental breakdown. I've seen murders, assaults, mutilations and everything else. It's shown me the worst parts of humanities and also that the good parts are extremely few and far in between.\nNow that I'm relatively stable, about to both work and do college full-time, I wanted to give humanity another chance to prove me wrong, but I think it's finally pushed me to my breaking point. Europe is having the most deadly war since WWII and everybody's looking at it from a numbers and patriotism standpoint instead of a humanity standpoint. I seriously don't think I can do this much longer.\nUpdate: My grandfather passed away two nights ago after being in the hospital for three weeks. My uncle called and told me that he went in for a mild case of pneumonia. Two weeks after he's admitted, my uncle calls me and tells me out of nowhere that my grandpa's lungs and kidneys both have failed and that he's refusing dialysis. Now that he's passed, I found out that they've set his funeral on a day that I can't be there because my job only has two employees - me and my boss, and my boss is going to be halfway across the country, so there's literally no way I can go to it. I really needed some form of closure, because thanks to being in legal trouble with my dad, we had a restraining order, and he went to my grandmother's viewing and funeral, which meant I couldn't be there. Now I can't be there for my grandfather because nobody consulted me when they were planning the date of his stuff.\nThe slip and slidal moments are back. They've been gone for about a year or so, but they started again some time in late January. I've always resolved that I would only take my own life if I had a handgun capable of instant death (a .9mm or higher), but last night, I impulsive straight up got out of bed and went to find the knife in my utensil drawer (I only have one knife that isn't a butter knife), and it wasn't there, so after I spent five minutes or so looking for it, I finally came back to reality and spent the entire night sobbing my eyes out.\nIt's too much. I'll leave nothing behind when I pass and I'm completely okay with that. Nobody would even know what happened, because I've told them that I've been considering moving either to Wyoming or Germany, so if I just stopped being responsive they'll assume that I've moved and stopped ghosting everybody. I have the perfect plan to end everything in a place where nobody will find my body, so nobody would be traumatized by seeing a corpse out somewhere, but so far I've been able to resist. I don't know why. I don't want to be here. I don't want things to get better anymore, I just want to be gone.\nIt's just.. getting to be too much.",

I\u2019ve gotten a few numbers from people in my classes and at the bar, but they haven\u2019t gone anywhere (yet).

I work at 3pm so for the past few months I\u2019ve literally been laying in bed for 12 hours. I work at a gym so working out helps me a lot, but as soon as I\u2019m home I would just feel like a lazy sack of meat and a failure. My friends are graduating and getting big boy jobs and I\u2019m just stuck. But recently I have started digging myself out of the hole. You have to realize what you\u2019re doing. The time that you should be using to better yourself and chase your dreams, you\u2019re using it instead to stress about what your family thinks and what the people around you are doing. Usually when you don\u2019t have any interest in school, you\u2019re a business man/ entrepreneur. I started a ATM business a few months ago and it\u2019s been great. It keeps me occupied when I\u2019m not at work, and the money motivates me to achieve financial freedom. All our friends who are in school are going to be 9-5 slaves until they\u2019re 65 and we don\u2019t want that life for ourselves, hence why we can\u2019t stay in a classroom lol. When you\u2019re successful and financially stable your family will realize you never needed a degree. Start taking risks and chances bc you\u2019re young. If you absolutely fucked up today, two years from now you\u2019ll be 25 and still young. Keep your head up and find your grind, a textbooks will not teach you how to live life!",

TW: self-harm i don\u2019t know what to do anymore atp that my thoughts are slowly just spilling and I\u2019m writing this as I\u2019m crying myself trying to sleep at 3:50 am. i can\u2019t stop thinking or imaging myself ways to die instantly because of school and just everything. I thought I was really doing better but guess not. Nothing gets better, people say it gets better maybe it does for a while but that\u2019ll go away. When can I stop feeling shit and stop overthinking about everything. I\u2019ve been failing school since the beginning of 10th grade this year, I don\u2019t have many friends and lost tons of friends in person because of how much I\u2019ve distance myself away from them because of my mental health and people at my school seems really nice but I\u2019m scared of being backstabbed. I\u2019ve tried everything to make myself get a better aspect of life or find things to change my view but nothing has worked. I hate it here so much. I dislike school because i feel different from everyone because I don\u2019t know how to do basic algebra or trigonometry regardless of how many times I\u2019ve tried studying it even after school hours, I hate having an learning disability and slow understanding. I\u2019m ugly truly, I\u2019ve been skipping school unexcused so many times and I\u2019m a online a student. How can a online student possibly fail online schooling? I\u2019m not even sure myself but I know that I\u2019m not even motivated just fucking myself over with these ruthless suicidal thoughts in my head and slowly giving up and just wanna end my life sooner. I\u2019m so sick and disgusted for even feeling this way because I know many kids/teenagers out there who want the privilege being accessed to free education,etc and they are probably going through way more than me.I just wanna get out of my body and be free. I love my family and gf/friends; they treat me well but I can\u2019t anymore going on. I\u2019m sorry whoever is reading this I was you well I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore.. i can\u2019t keep gaming as my therapy and to escape reality 24/7. My mind is feeding me up so much and I wanna visit my hamster and grandpa up there when I pass. Have a goodnight/goodmorning or good afternoon where ever you are.",

In my old job I used to have ideas and I added value, now in my new job although probably more boring, the hours suit my family life. \nSince starting I thought I\u2019d be able to help to the place around come up with new systems but no, I can\u2019t I have nothing in me. \nI feel heavy and slow all the time even at home, I am like a vegetable just watching tv. \nI can\u2019t seem to just get up and go, I have no goals no drive no ambition; I don\u2019t know where to start, I feel like I\u2019ve lost everything I used to enjoy. I feel like I need a breakdown and start over but that\u2019s not possible I have to keep going for my daughter. \nHow do I see clearly again",

Your thoughts are valid but, not \"normal\" healthy rational thought patterns. \"No shit!\" Right?\nMy point is...speaking with a counselor, therapist, being open with friends or family can go a long way. \nLike I said, I wish some looked out for me when I was younger. I wish I was put on an antidepressant back when I could've made better choices and a life for myself. At least give yourself a fighting chance at life instead of fighting yourself for life!",

Your weight or looks are not your personality. When focusing excklusively on that, people will never get to know you. If you want it to change, you need to change it. Self pity is not helping. Attractive is not the person who lost a lot of weight, but the person who is able to identify a problem, reflect on it and then act on it.",

I didn\u2019t go to the gym tho I just found a job which requires a lot of physical activity like fedex and Amazon. I was basically getting paid for losing fat. I believe I lost the extreme depressive mood due to socializing but most of my depression is due to questions about life and meaning.

But it's not viable to hide them or anything of that nature. In the midst of these this and urges, are the voices and paranoia, the feelings of worthlessness, the belief that people hate me. Being trans and watching the nation try to make my existence illegal only worsens the matter.\nSo, I turn to what takes my mind off everything. Alcohol and pills. When I'm drunk or high, I don't care about all that. Yeah, I'm screwed up still, but it doesn't matter. Nothing does. So I've been day drinking and ignoring the doctor's suggestions to cut back on the substances. My body is slowly falling apart, but it was doing that anyway.\nI still have plenty of time when I'm sober. And I hate it. If I'm not sleeping, I'm fighting my own mind. And I don't know how to have a conversation about this with anyone. Not my friends, not my psychiatrist, not my therapist, not the volunteers that run all the helplines.\nIdk. I'm just lost.",

I go to the gym 5 days a week, have plenty of friends I hang out with, a loving family, and am somewhat under control of my bad habits now. It\u2019s like no matter what I do nothing changes. I still can\u2019t make myself work, I can\u2019t focus for some reason even though I think my major is interesting. I\u2019m so deeply sad and anxious. I\u2019m just a passive coward. I hate doing bad in life and it makes me more depressed, but I was already fucking depressed when I was doing good. Like wtf????? What am I supposed to do?? Everyone acts like they have answers when really, no one has a clue what to do. No one knows how to fix me. I doubt I can. My brain always finds a way to make me doubt myself. Never once have I had confidence in what I do. I freeze in most social situations and just say something stupid.\nI hate people who preach \u201cdopamine detox\u201d and say it helped them get through their \u201cdepression\u201d. Like I already fucking do that man. I take cold showers, I\u2019m not addicted to anything, I dont drink or smoke a lot, and I push myself everyday and I still wish I was dead. So fuck you and literally everything that you stand for. You know nothing about mental health and you shouldn\u2019t be preaching this bullshit to kids and people who are already struggling to even live. It\u2019s not victim culture, it\u2019s depression and there\u2019s no cure to it. It\u2019s how I\u2019m hard wired. I genuinely wish there was a cure, I wish you were right and I could just slowly learn to love life. But I never loved it in the first place, and if I did, I\u2019ve already forgotten what that felt like.\nSorry I\u2019m angry rn lol, just needed to vent. I dont actually hate everyone, I hate what some people say or do when they don\u2019t know anything. Just tired of people not understanding or not even trying to understand. I really want to live a happy life with a girl I love but its really hard seeing myself there. I don\u2019t like coming on here and spewing negativity but I feel like I have to or I\u2019ll lose it.
