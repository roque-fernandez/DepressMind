 "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.\nIn addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  \nIf you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers\u2019 problems.",

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement.

It happens sometimes at my IRL crisis line, most often because they've never had a supportive conversation before they talked to us, so they kind of \"imprint\" on us (we literally call them \"ducklings\").  It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

I\u2019m still trying, but it seems as if it\u2019s not enough. \nToo rational, too cold, too calculated, even more than before. I don\u2019t and can\u2019t subscribe to the \u201cthings will magically work out somehow\u201d mentality. That\u2019s not how I live. There's so much luck you can have before it runs out. The fact that I have a roof over my head and can still support myself now is because I had an exit strategy back when I started college in case I wouldn\u2019t want to continue with the major after graduating, not because some mysterious being pitied me and decided to help me. Guess I\u2019m still bitter over those thinly veiled dehumanizing beliefs I was fed with, which now looking back on this, were not subtle at all. How could I not? All you can see was how I went from being a fundamentalist to an ex-religious in less than two weeks, two months, or three months. But how would you have known anything about the process that led up to it, the struggle, doubting, questioning, fighting and deceiving myself, and leaving the foundation, the things, the people who I held dear most to my life? I\u2019d already left my family of origin\u2014the first people who were supposed to love and accept me. Of course it\u2019d stink the second time. \nPerhaps being empty-handed is a good thing. There\u2019s no meaning to anything. No sign. No fixed future destination. Which is exactly why I\u2019m free to do anything. Be a good person because I wanna do it, not because of the desire of eternal rewards. Allow myself to slip up and not constantly thought police myself.   \nIsn\u2019t this freeing?",

I have no distraction; media helps at times, but then I'm back to reality, back to the pain. I am currently unemployed and looking to apply to multiple jobs, but barely hearing anything back or getting a fucking interview makes me just want to throw in the towel. I wish things were different, and I wish I was different, but I'm not. Everything, even the smallest event to others, is amplified to me. I am pushing because I genuinely want to reach peace one day, but the work to get there is just mentally and physically tiring. I've isolated myself from a lot of people and definitely ruined friendships and relationships because I'm rotting inside. I don't want to go out to hang with friends anymore because I hate being in public more than anything, and pretending to be happy and present almost feels like I'm being overly fake. I'm tired. I'm exhausted with life, and my life in particular. I'm trying to take things one day at a time, but I don't know how much time I have. Holding on, holding on.",

Things were fine until I messed it all up again because that's all I ever do with friendships and deep personal relationships, I inevitably fuck things up and drive people away.

It's better to space it out over multiple days.  \nProbably due to not going to the gym today.  \nLittle brother is a piece of shit. Pulled a knife on me cuz he can't ever back off or apologize. Entitled kid who wanted to cut off the edges on bread since he couldn't eat those. I guess leaving him the majority of the junk food for 9 years because he ate nothing else contributed to this entitledness.  \nSo I don't have many people to talk to since my brother is a judgemental narcissist.",

 "text": "I have so many regrets. I hate the life that I've crafted for myself. I'm almost out of my twenties with nothing to show for it. No friends, no memorable experiences, no long term happy relationship, no career to speak of it. I've hardly done anything with my 20's. I can't believe it. I hate the phrase \"you're so young, you still have time\". Yeah, I used to think that, and now I'm still in the same position as when all those people used to say that to me. Now I'm not so young anymore. Thinking that I was 'still young' was a mistake. It just causes you to slack and not try as hard to change circumstances because \"well, i have time, i'll do it tomorrow, next week, next month\". No, you don't have time. Time is the most expensive thing and you never get it back. All the experiences I dreamed of having when I was younger, that I was gonna become a beacon of my community and change lives... lol even just simple things like wanting to walk around the mall with a friend or watch a movie with someone, all my dreams are dead and buried. High school me would've been so disappointed. I would've killed myself back then if I knew I'd be where I am now.\nAnyway, trying to get into a new jobfield. I'm upset and annoyed that I've been waiting since August to work with this company, but I still have 2 interviews to do and then 3 weeks of training, only if I pass the interviews (and now I have to spend money on interview clothes). I won't be able to start working until December, maybe January. I just thought the process would be quicker but now it's gonna take so long. I need money now. This whole process is slowing me down and I'm extremely antsy, haven't been employed since July 2022 I'm so bored just being in the house all day, nothing excites me and I can't afford to do anything. It is so stressful being a human. I wish I didn't have to do any of this stuff. I don't even know what I'm doing it for either. I'd be getting a job just to help me continue to survive... but I don't like living. I don't want to make money to keep living longer. I guess the solution would be to starve... I hate this world so much, I hope for more climate disasters to come and hopefully Earth will the finish the process of exterminating us wretched humans who don't appreciate mother Earth, we just take from her, hoard, and make things worse for our fellow human.",

 "text": "I got into an argument with my 23 year old brother. He's been really selfish lately since when I ask him to talk or drop me off somewhere or anything really small he's always making excuses for why he can't do it. He'll say he'd rather not, or he's not good at talking to people, or my room is too messy and so is his if I ask for someone to talk to. Barely see him despite living next door to him. I'm much older and watched over him when he was younger all the time, giving him his bottle, even occasionally helping change diapers.  \nRecently I asked if I could use his curry to make some curry (with vegetables I bought). He said no, since he'd have to buy more. I thought of this as a last straw. He's always critical of whatever I do. But fuck there's empty toilet rolls on the ground in the bathroom and have been for months even before I arrived. He's not some paragon of a person himself, can't even bring it outside the bathroom to the trash.  \nI said fine I won't use his curry but not to eat the food I buy. He eats pb and j or whatever desserts I buy. Then he tried to say that I can't use the family's white car, that our parents own, because he uses it for work. He's been really possessive about the white car, the only one he's willing to drive cuz he's a spoiled little shit, for years. Wants to take it if he moves out but I know he probably won't move out. My parents don't bother him nearly enough.  \nWhen we go dragon boating he says it's ok to drive there after we'd decided to go by public transit but only if I drive. He's always trying to get out of doing any work. He just doesn't want to drive or pay for parking. He tries to get me to fill up the gas tank even being so spiteful as to come back with a near empty tank since he accuses me of always using the car. The thing is, and I argue this, I mostly only use it for local trips 2 miles away, not hour long commutes to work.  \nBut whatever it's only $40 I go fill up the tank. He wants me to fill up the white car half the time. The car that was supposed to go to me. But he's the one who uses it like 70% of the miles, my mom using 20%, and me another like 10%. How is this fair?  \nHe says I can't eat anything he makes anymore. And then threatens me with an \"are you sure you want to go down this route?\" Honestly I'm not sure if this is even worth reconciling. He's my brother, we don't choose our brothers. And I don't even know how we turned out so different. Genes probably. I can never get away from him being my brother but I sure can limit how much I talk to him.  \nHe's 23. All these years of me giving him the good room, him giving me the shitty chair he broke, always leaving more desserts and junk food for him when we were younger because I know he liked them, taking him to the park, giving him only compliments and trying to help him, getting into games to try to play them with him, teaching him science, playing with him daily, letting him use my laptop from games when I got back from work during internships. Sharing it when we were younger and giving him more time. And now I find out he's just a prick who doesn't care about any of it.  \nWhat do I do? If it were a friend I'd just cut the toxicity out of my life. Perhaps I let him get away with too much. Perhaps my mom let him become transactional when he was younger and that somehow developed into his narcissistic personality.",
