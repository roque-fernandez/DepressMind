 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

I\u2019d say I\u2019ve even been doing better the last couple months. \nBut I\u2019m very very scared of falling into the familiar pattern of despair and pain. I\u2019m surrounded by triggers every day. I\u2019ve gone out of my way to cut out social media/news/people who are gonna be reminders but I worry the most about my own mental fortitude. There were days last year where I didn\u2019t know if I could keep going forward.",

I had a brief moment where I felt I wouldn\u2019t get these feelings and urges but my bad thoughts came back and I drank to get the bad thoughts away and the negative thinking. It sucks feeling like these thoughts could never come back but they do and it\u2019s usually worse than normal.",

My negative self-talking is getting worse, and I have been having more urges to self-harm. I journaled to help figure out my emotions last night--it helped, but I'm still struggling to find the energy or motivation to do much.   \nI'm trying to have patience with myself this weekend.",

Spent all day in bed just feeling like garbage. I\u2019ve been spiraling further and further down this depression hole. Each day has been worse than the last. Im proud I was able to stand up for myself for once and take a much needed break. \u2764\ufe0f",
