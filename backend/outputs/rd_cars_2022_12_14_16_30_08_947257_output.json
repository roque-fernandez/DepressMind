    "text": "I don't think there's an EV in your price range that can carry 8' plywood easily while being smaller than a full-size pickup. I'm not sure what to tell you. Maybe someone can correct me.\nIf you like the size of the EV6 and the Ioniq 5, regardless of their not-great ability to haul long things, they're both excellent vehicles and definitely high on my list of fairly affordable EVs. The Ford Mach E is also great -- you'd pay a bit more than the EV6 or Ioniq 5 for a Mach E with AWD and the extended range battery, but you get a better driving experience and a cool interior space. I like the Volvo XC40 Recharge in the luxury brands, as well as the Genesis GV70 and Cadillac Lyriq, but none of these are particularly large inside.",

    "text": "Location: Northern MO\nLease/Buy: Buy.\nNew/Used: New if I can\nType: Camaro ZL1\nTransmission: this is what I need help on.\nFirst vehicle: no. I currently daily an '03 Honda pilot, but I've also driven a few other cars, mostly automatics though.\nConsiderations: I'm planning on getting a camaro zl1 before they die since it's been a dream car for years, I just don't know what transmission to try and get. The automatic comes with paddle shifters, so I'd still have control of gear changes if I go that route but actual manual is also kinda fun to do. My problem is I'd likely end up using this as my new daily and I have some serious adhd problems, so I'm not sure if being forced to change my gears every time I drive is gonna be a good option. And on top of that, I've driven a grand total of 2 manual cars, and both have been below 400hp, so jumping to 650 may be a little much but I'm not sure. Anyone with any experience, I'd love to hear your experience and thoughts to help me come to a decision.",
