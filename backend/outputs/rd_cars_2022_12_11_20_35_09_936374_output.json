Also, insurance is going to be a nightmare, as I dont have any driving history in the US. I will be there for 3 years and would prefer not to do anything major on my car in this time.I have a rental for 30 days paid by the company. So either I need it \"right away\" or until april, as I am elsewhere for the whole march, and could pay myself for a rental for February.",

Want something with space inside and enough for 2 car seats. We have the CX-5 now and the car seat forces the passenger seat up a lot, so want to avoid that issue in the future. Don\u2019t mind waiting the 6-9 months for a car to be built to my wants at MSRP. \nThanks guys",
