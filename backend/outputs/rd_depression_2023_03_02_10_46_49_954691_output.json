 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to go, but therapy has never really helped me with this problem and I can't bring it up to my mom or grandparents because I'm tired of the endless cycle of me justifiably bringing up an issue and them starting a fight. There's a thousand and one reasons I have depression relating to every poor way my parents \"parented\" me growing up from the neglect of my dad and blatant abuse of my mom and grandfather. But the thing that drove me up a fucking wall today was, my grandmom retired recently and she can't find anything to keep her busy so she just keeps fixing random crap around our house that doesn't need fixing, and bugging the rest of us. I suggested she journal, read, or write a story, she thought it was a good idea, so I went down into our basement guest room where I have a lot of my things stored from college still, to find her a book. And it was re-arranged when my grandparents retired so my grandfather could work on his coin collection. I walk into the room and see my stuff re-arranged. Oh well, as long as it's there neat I'm cool with it. Then I turn around and see the 5 journals I kept through the 3 years of college I had, lined up next to a bunch of old school work and art work my uncle made when he was a kid that my grandmom and mom have been reading and laughing over. So I have this irking and explosive rage building up in me right now that's there because I feel it's pretty obvious that my mom and grandmom have been reading my private shit. It's making me want to explode and yell at them all right now, but I know they'll just try and gas light me and spin on me that I'm the bad guy. I know the easy answer is \"its their house, they can do what they want, move out\", and I've heard it before. But I am trying to move out, it's difficult, and even if I am living here, I bought those journals, and I wrote them when I was living at school, that doesn't give them the right to invade my privacy. And if I haven't mentioned this already the reason I'm so paranoid is because my mom has read my journal without my consent before, during covid, when I was at a really low place with depression working my ass off to pass online physics and chemistry classes that are impossible enough in person and I was going crazy studying extra hours online to pass. And she took everything I wrote out of context, and even though she was barely even mentioned in my journal entries, she decided to take the whole thing personally and cause more problems for me by calling me selfish and starting more fights. I think she's bipolar or borderline personality, because I flipped out at her to never do that again or I'd leave the house and stop talking to her, and she did it again after a few weeks, so I started leaving threats in my journal to hurt her, knowing she'd disobey the one thing I ask of her, hoping she'd stop, but she just started more shit, and then suddenly started leaving weird fake sentimental notes in my journals and always found them no matter where I hid them, as if that would somehow absolve her of the fact she's invading my privacy, insincere apology written in a book your forbidden to write in or not, that's still going against the one thing I ask her not to do, so I followed through and I left mid-way through covid and lived with my dad until move in day the following semester at college, barely speaking to my mom. Then I move back in with her after college and a year goes by, nothing bad except a few arguments, and now we're here, where I see all of my journals removed from where I put them, all neatly stacked in ORDER BY YEAR, making me believe she STILL went against my wishes and read my shit. \nWhat can I do about this until I can move out? I don't want to bring this up to her or my grandparents because I don't want to deal with my mom starting shit and making me feel bad for being born at the moment. And I'm not on good terms with my dad either (long story short he ran off and started a new family with an abusive woman who treated me and my sister like garbage) so I can't just simply up and move there. This is just the tip of the ice berg on how my family has treated me, there is much worse out there that they've done in my life but this is the most recent thing. And I feel really bad saying this but, I've never been a violent person, I've never wanted to hurt anyone nor have I ever attempted to without reasonable cause (self-defense), but I catch myself wishing my family would just all up and die some days, like since I can't get out yet it feels like the only relief I'll get is them all just permanently shutting up. When I finally get to move out I'm just going to cut her off as well as my grandparents and maybe my dad (I say maybe because I still have young half siblings living with him that I would like to be able to know), but for now the only feelings I have for them is dread and the horrifying desire for them to just stop existing. I don't know how to handle this anger, I just know that it's going to eat away at me until something bad happens, like an early life heart attack or something, my blood pressure is already high for my age and it's only gotten higher because of the stress and anger my family causes, I don't know what to do.",

 "text": "So I'm graduating university soon, honours and everything. It's a huge achievement and everyone is congratulating me and telling me I ought to be so proud of myself.  Since I have horrible mental health, it was a real struggle to get through - there were so many sleepless nights, breakdowns and I pushed myself to my absolute limit on many occasions. So reaching the end should be a pretty big victory.\nWhen I started uni, I was basically a recluse who didn't know how to talk to people and had zero social life. However, through a combination of therapy, medication and just how easy uni makes it to socialise, I managed to really come out of my shell. I became the president of a campus social club. Went on a lot of dates. Made some friends. Worked on some really interesting projects. Hell, I even started dressing well. I've been told I'm practically unrecognizable compared to the way I was when I started. It's a real success story. University doesn't necessarily make anything easier, but it makes the opportunities to improve more accessible - want to make friends? Here's a specific event you can go to this week filled with people that have similar interests. It sets you up for success, if you can push yourself to go for it.\nSo after saying all that, you may be wondering what I'm doing here. The problem is, I feel like the only part of my life that's ever mattered is over. These past years have been so eventful and vibrant, and I'm only just realising that now that it's ending. Sort of like how you don't realise when the good old days are until they're over.  What am I even supposed to do with myself now? Nothing will ever be as exciting, and all the social opportunities I enjoyed are going to be much fewer and far between. It might seem silly to be sad about literally achieving my goals, but the university lifestyle is just so dynamic and interesting and I don't want it to end.\nA few people know that I've been struggling with this, but I don't think anybody realises the full extent.  I feel like I've been wearing a mask. A few months from now when I step up onto that stage and accept my degree, it feels like my life will be over.  Like if I ended things right there, that would be fine and I would have ended up a high note. For a while I didn't even want to end things anymore, but now I'm starting to feel that way again.\nI feel worse than I have in ages and it's because I turned myself around and am close to achieving something I've been working towards for a long time. Sounds silly when I say it out loud. But it's how I'm feeling right now.",

I already had to go to the hospital twice for a chest drain which was not a very pleasant experience. I however don't get why because everything went well and everyone was so nice, but I am still terrified. I know I have had it happen more than twice because I have felt the same symptoms multiple times on other occasions, but I am to scared to do anything. But because it happened twice already the chance of it happening again is big and everytime it happens there advice for an operation is stronger, which greatly decreases the chance. This time  I said I said I will wait till next time and get the operation then. I am still scared though, but I also want it to be over so badly. One of the reasons I said no this time is because for a while now I haven't felt great, which stupid enough I am also too scared to say to anyone. But at the moment I am also so scared I will get it again now, which wants to make me get the surgery just to get over with it.",

 "text": "Sorry in advance for the wall of text, but I can see where you are and I believe my experience will be helpful to you\nThe first, and hardest, step to becoming better is to recognise that you have a problem - which you have done. The thought \"There's probably nothing actually wrong with me\" is the depression speaking. Know that you are self aware enough to see the problem, intelligent enough to know you can't fix everything yourself, and strong enough to seek help. No matter what else the depression has taken from you I can see these 3 things, and more, from your comment alone.\nThe thing about our mind is that absolutely every thing we experience, from hearing a sound to seeing light to watching an action unfold, and everything in between, is simply an interpretation of what's going on around us. The first and most important thing you always have to keep in mind is that YOU ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS. You are the filter that screens and sorts them; your are the junction between \"thought\", \"Memory\", and \"physical action\". You are the observer within your body, whom takes the information available to them and moves their body accordingly. What this means is that what you feel is not you either. You experience the emotion, yes, but it eventually passes. Even if it takes days or weeks for any relief, it will eventually pass. \nThat was a little wordy but what I'm getting at is that what you feel and think are not trivial. Every sensation that passes through your mind is significant and important, because you ARE experiencing it - the feeling or thought never would have occured in the first place if you weren't. \nThe next big point that I want to make is that the people in your life want to hear about these things from you. Maybe not everyone, and definitely not all the time (because even if time has stopped for us we still need to remember that time still moves for everyone else), but I 100% guarantee that you have someone in your life that is willing to hear about what's on your mind.\nI won't be able to say much more without straying into advice territory, so this is what I did to pull myself out of my head:\nA) I accepted that something was wrong and that there were professionals who not only knew more than me, but knew better. \nB) I accepted that I didn't have to control absolutely every aspect of my life in order to feel safe. Isolation and irritability cleaved a lot from my life, and that's okay.\nC) I accepted that getting anywhere in life takes a long time, often 3 or 4 times what I would initially expect. It's unreasonable to expect yourself to be instantly successful or good at what you do; allow yourself the time to make the early general mistakes before you zero in on the details\nD) I found ways to get advice about my problems without directly bringing them up; this was only really helpful to get me started, though. Being clear and concise of what you experience will allow others to help you much more.\nE) I got medicated\nF) I went to therapy\nEvery step is an insurmountable cliff with winds threatening to blow you off at any moment - but I know that with your dedication to becoming a better person that you will be able to do it.\nLet me know if you need anything clarified or expanded on, it's a little all over the place",

From her and my \"work\".\nI told her about how unhappy I was in my profession and she was like well you should have said something earlier! Acting like it was my fault for never admitting to unhappiness when I did throughout she just never listened or cared. \nThen she went on to call my career her greatest accomplishment \"helping me through it\". I have no internal motivation it's all her. The emeshment is so bad. I dont even know where I begin and she begins  in terms of my career. It's so triggering and horrible. I literally hate doing work at all. I need career counseling badly. \nMy family dynamic triggers me:\nThen she said I was mad at my brother bc I wouldn't encourage his addiction. Which is sick. I have been worried about and trying to help him with his addiction but she just encourages it and guilts me into encouraging it too. She is sick. She treats him like a literal baby and makes food for him and hes 40. It's highly inappropriate and highly triggering and borderline incest. It grosses me out to no end. How do I tell her, I'm not mad at him? I'm just disgusted, and disappointed in both of them for letting this continue. I can only say so much. If they want to phase me out so be it, how dare they abuse me still after so long. \nThe only thing is I feel like I \"need\" my mom to encourage me through a damn work day bc I then get something done. But you know what forget it. It's not worth it. The pain. The emeshment. The disgusting confusing twisted agendas where she wants to relive her life through me and treat me like an infant simultaneously no matter how it cripples me. \nI just dont want to \"get in trouble\" at work by showing how little motivation I truly have, how much disdain for the job. I have the mind of a toddler. I have been crippled in my life and highly dependent on my parents. I dont know how to escape, I feel trapped in every regard. \nAnd my brother is worse. I cant even hold a conversation with him any more. He doesnt make sense, I wonder if he is in psychosis from how long he has been trapped like this. This is disgusting to me. \nI feel \"put together\" when my parents do it all for me bc I cant do it myself. Its poison, they poison me. They never once wanted me to grow up.\nCognitive Distortions: Labeling self, negative evaluation of self.\nChallenge: I can find a better job more suited to me without my family \"encouraging\" me. I can do this without them. I dont need to be the scapegoat or enable their bad behaviors.\nPlan: Spend weekend looking for family and career therapists and finding \"peer support\".",

I told him not the first time we met at least. And one thing let to another and I gave him head. After he finished, I felt that energy shift of him being interested to him just wanting to get me home. Quite frankly I felt it too. the worst part is I texted him after asking what he was looking for. Not because I care about dating him but bc I genuinely enjoyed conversing with him today. I just want a damn friend. I just want someone to hug me and listen to me. I don\u2019t want to feel so stupid and self-critical all the time. I\u2019ve been feeling so scatterbrained lately and I don\u2019t know whether to quit taking my meds or not. I just wanna graduate school already. If I new how to swim I\u2019d just like to lay in the middle of a lake and cry. I wish I could drown my thoughts out. I wish I could scream so loudly that all the shit in my body would be released. I feel stuck and lost and lonely and it is a shitty feeling. I lost my whole friend group and my ex. I feel so tired all the time. I hate so many things about myself and though I\u2019ve been in therapy for 5 years I learned how to feel apathetic towards my existence. My little brother once told me that if anyone would una**** themselves in the family it would be me. And though he might have said it half jokingly I believe it would be me too. And I fear my whole family thinks that way. I feel so fucking weak and I just want to be tended to and cared for. I understand that I must internalize shit and take care of me\u2026 but to be Frank I\u2019m tired of me. I don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want to be me anyone.  I just feel so exhausted.

We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker.

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.\nFor the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.\nNow when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much can't do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.\nWhich is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.\nI don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort.",

It happens sometimes at my IRL crisis line, most often because they've never had a supportive conversation before they talked to us, so they kind of \"imprint\" on us (we literally call them \"ducklings\").  It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

 "text": "I agree, and I appreciate scorpionstanks and others good intentions. It's amazing to see that volunteerism and sometimes it does help those with depression. But agency/community contact is important. Everyone gets compassion fatigue. Having seen and heard our crisis coordinators, some of the most compassionate individuals I've met after a 12 hour shift. And you get the idea that their rapport building and call quality goes down substantially. \nThese are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall, but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift.",

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

 "text": "I felt similar today. Reading this made me feel better. It's a bit dark so prepare yourself but it helps to know that the world is the thing that's wrong not us. \nMine will probably be the darkest answer you will find. It really depends on which side of the fence you sit on. Back a long long time ago we had greeks who defined the lines in social status, placing most on the bottom while raising a few to the top who took power. Next came the Romans who added onto this with harsh and severe competition and social acceptance was only extended to those who won. A society so harsh they decided the weak should be dead, not an altogether different idea than Hitler had. Flush the weak and damaged out to produce a perfect and undefeatable society. The US and so very many other nations adopted this as a model for society. Much less harsh, society in the US is still using this model. Money is status, and you only get money through being competitive. Anyone who \u201closes\u201d or simply refuses to play gets the shaft. Women still view men based on physical prowess as if a lion is going to suddenly pop up and he might have to chuck a few speers for your survival. Men still brag about their physical conquests both in sex and physical fights. We like to pretend we are oh so evolved but are we? But wait, there\u2019s more. Everything good we were ever taught, every moral and principle that was given to us in a positive light is in complete opposition with living. We lie constantly, we lie at the beginning of relationships and in jobs. We lie to ourselves probably at least once an hour. If we just look over there and ignore the bad then the bad doesn\u2019t exist. How many times a day do you hear \u201cliving the dream\u201d? How many interviews have you had to lie in because you know the other 923 applicants also lied and it's the only way you\u2019re going to get a job? You absolutely cannot be a good moral, principal-having person in this society. As such, anyone who is anywhere across the line or even close to the line of being a good person is going to struggle heavily in this society. What's completely laughable is that social acceptance fuels 90% of people's decisions. When to obtain social acceptance you have to be apathetic, opportunistic, and greedy\u2026. in other words, we\u2019re seeking the acceptance of people who will never accept us anyway. I mean who tf wants to become a monster just to befriend monsters? Pretty sure that's not why anyone wanted social acceptance. We want this so we\u2019re not alone, we want this so we feel included and loved. But to get there we have to become someone who can barely love themselves let alone others? When the truth of the world is revealed and you stop lying to yourself about how many horrors are out there it becomes a really dark fkn place. You can take this to the bank, do NOT have hope that anyone will do anything about any of it. FAR too many people bought into the generational conditioning and are now brainwashed into thinking this is ok\u2026 this is all as it should be\u2026 ofc those people are usually the ones who have decided to trade in their dignity to belong to a society that would just as soon crush you like a bug than give up a raise or promotion to you. Just GREAT people on this earth\u2026 If God does exist it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to find out he ran the fuck away from us. I know I would. Talk about a disappointment\u2026",

Figure it out and write it down.\nIf you cannot afford, either increase cash flow or decrease expenses.\nThis may involve having to find a better paying job or learning a new skill, or moving somewhere else that pays for your line of work better.\nLife is rough, but the more you do it, the easier it gets.\nYou are not responsible for anyone but yourself. Blood doesn't mean shit. I've been taken advantage of enough in my life but blood is just another excuse and if your mom cared enough for you... I would never ever ask foroney from my kids. I'm sorry but it is just my opinion but I am sorry. My heart hurts for you. If I wasn't looking for a house for me and my kids...\nDon't give up. Back to rule 1 of writing it down. That is your goal. You need to tell yourself I am going to pay of this debt in X years months days etc. I will do this by y and z or any other letter to get it done. It sounds dumb but writing things down like this really works if you keep trying it.\n\nI kind of trailed off at the end there with some random motivation jargon, but if you give yourself a destination it takes some of the worry off of your mind that \"I'm never going to pay off this debt\". Don't let your mind boss you around. And don't forget to make time for things that make you happy. Doing these two things, I believe, will help you bring out your true character. I believe you can do this. Even if it's a little at a time. 1% is still better than 0.",

I barely work on my degree and the day is dull having no productive stimulation.\nSomething that does help is having the philosophy of no zero days. If I spend too much time thinking about what I \"should\" be doing, I'm paralyzed. Practicing just a bit of guitar, walking just 15 minutes, working just a bit of my degree keeps me at least level enough during my depressive episodes until I start to swing out of them. \nJust know your feelings are valid, don't let other people minimize where you are because others minimizing your struggle won't help you break out of it, it just digs you deeper.

 "text": "Lost two of my pets in one day and now I just feel sick. Yesterday I took my favorite cat ducky to the vet because he\u2019s been having issues with an abscess in his mouth. He\u2019s 15 and he was born in my house, and he\u2019s always been my sidekick. Always there to keep me company when I\u2019m withdrawn from life. Anyway the vet told me that we could keep treating it, but that he\u2019s got to be in pain and it won\u2019t heal and it\u2019s getting worse every time. I of course couldn\u2019t let my best friend continue on in pain so I made the hard decision to say goodbye. I spent nearly an hour sobbing and hugging him before the vet did it. \nSo I come home devastated to my second cat Izzy. I\u2019ve had her since she was a kitten and she\u2019s a year older than ducky. When ducky was born Izzy would constantly steal ducky from the mother and take him to her bed, so naturally we had to keep him. She knew right away that something was up when I came home without ducky. They were best friends. Izzy has been having a lot of issues but she seemed to be doing well, until last night. She started breathing extremely heavy and threw up. I immediately left with her for the emergency vet but she passed on the way. I\u2019m 100% sure she died of a broken heart. \nNow I\u2019m sitting here alone with my own broken heart. I\u2019m absolutely devastated. I called into work and my boss is awesome and gave me the rest of the week off but I kinda feel like I need the distraction. Sorry if this was long and rambling. I just need support as I\u2019ve lost all of mine in one day. They were basically my ESA\u2019s. Also any ideas on how to properly memorialize them would be appreciated. I honestly even thought that far ahead but they\u2019re being cremated. I\u2019m going to my parents to pick up my childhood German Shepard for a while so hopefully he\u2019ll be a good distraction. Anyway I\u2019m sorry for the rambling. RIP Ducky and Izzy.",

Of course, there are gradations, but I have read of plenty of people who talk about not being able to get out of bed for days, or weeks. How do they maintain a job and support themselves? How do they survive and manage to stave off the conclusion until another day?\nFor years I have recognized that I have depression, which saps away my will or my capacity to enjoy even the most basic things. I found coping mechanisms, friends, therapy, other things, and they have all helped for a time, but everything gradually loses its ameliorative effect. I'm usually good at masking it until it builds up too much and I have a panic episode, and those have been becoming more frequent. I have had the advantage of having family nearby to help with food and housing, so I only have to work part-time to support myself in my studies, but due to family situations that is about to change. Right now, I just have episodes where I lie on the ground for hours or can stave off incapacitation until the weekend, but what about when it gets worse, and I have to shoulder everything on my own? How do other people do it?",

Bad social anxiety, always overthinking, super sensitive, getting very angry for no reason etc. For the past year I've been getting fuced over by friends, girls, etc. I figured If I had a gf, friends, my life will get better. Slowly I've been getting friends, and I got a girlfriend. Yet im still unhappy. I'm working out, eating healthy, stopped doing a lot of drugs, yet im still an angry depressed little bich. I'll be sitting around doing nothing and I'll feel a sense of burning anger all throughout my body. This caused me to punch 20 holes in my walls over the course of 3 months, i cry for no reason at random times throughout the day. Last night I was laying in bed, everything was going good, I was texting my girl having a fun convo, I was otp with my friends laughing my ass off. 5 mins later I turn off my phone ready to go to bed, and I feel this burning anger come throughout me. This caused me to punch a hole in my wall. For no God damn reason. I even punch myself in the face. Gave myself multiple black eyes. I'll be in class and randomly ill get a sudden urge to just smack the person next to me over the littlest things. Every single night I come home from work I have a temper tantrum and I smash things and break them. What the hell is wrong with me.",

I have been on Seroquel for 6 months; it does help my OCD but not my depression or anxiety at all. \nI have been on Valdoxan for 6 weeks.

Plus I the severity of these thoughts are becoming less and less with time but certain days they are not great, people who take meds are getting better.

I don\u2019t know what to do. I have done absolutely nothing with my life and even though my parents don\u2019t say it I know they are disappointed in me. I binge eat constantly every day to numb the pain which only helps temporarily but also makes things worse since I keep gaining weight. \nMy life is nothing but an embarrassment. My parents spent so much money to get me help with my binge eating which I have been struggling with since age 11. Whenever I had negative emotions I would sneak as much food as humanely possible, and eat as much as humanly possible. My mom thinks it\u2019s because I like to be a sneak no matter what. My parents are getting a divorce and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the reason. My sister hates my guts and wants nothing to do with me. Most of my friends do not want to associate with me anymore.\nIt\u2019s so humiliating. My cousins make fun of me because my parents give me all of this fake praise and I laugh with them. My friends don\u2019t invite me to anything anymore because they think I am a waste of space, I don\u2019t have any other friends. \nI have been to 5 different high schools (no joke!) and the only way I was able to get peoples approval was to act dumb. I remember one day where I got stuck in a chair and everyone was laughing and recording me cause I was fat and couldn\u2019t get out of the chair. I embraced this and became the class clown, and I stopped trying in high school. I\u2019m convinced that my parents had to bribe someone so I could graduate. This is how my whole family and friends view me now. They all think I\u2019m a complete retard.  It\u2019s the only way I can get people to like me. Now I\u2019m paying the price.\nI was sent to a treatment facility for my binge eating  when I was 15-17. People there were raped and assaulted, molested their siblings, arrested, beat cops, did heroin, and I was sent their for binge eating. \nI have (and this is true), no actual achievements from any sport, academics, etc. All I did was waste my life binge eating and blocking out everyone as humanly possible.\nI know I need to grow up and get a life, but I long for the days when I was happy with my friends family and cousins, not a worry in the world, we were just happy you know? Those days are gone and will never come back. Now I live in spite and hatred over all of the people I loved. I hate my cousins, I hate my sister, I hate my friends. \nThere is a part of me that really wants to change my entire life and prove to everyone I\u2019m not the dumbass they think I am. The other part of me wants to give up entirely and binge eat until I die. \nI don\u2019t want to face the people I love anymore. I cannot stand the fact that I have brought shame to my family.\nI just want to die.",

 "text": "I have no motivation to move forward or do anything further with my life anymore This is obviously a throwaway.  I don\u2019t have anything good in my life anymore.  My parents pay for my expenses, which are no more than food and insurance.  I literally own nothing to my name.  My entire life is a complete joke.  I don\u2019t know how to break this cycle.  I don\u2019t even know how it started.  I just wish I could do something more.\nWhen I was in high school I had a lot of ambition to do something good with my life.  I used to think about being an actor, or screenwriter.  I remember joining a video club in high school, but the problem was, I knew nothing about video.  That\u2019s why I joined this club.  The people in this club were already good at video production, sound editing, all that jazz.  No worries, if anything I thought this was good.  That means I could learn.  Turns out I\u2019m a slow learner.  I tried to operate some equipment one day and accidentally deleted something important to another student.  This student was obviously livid and asked the teacher to kick me out of the club.  The club advisor agreed and I was no longer welcome.  I also learned he was the only teacher in my school doing video production classes.  Knowing this, I couldn\u2019t join anything in school anymore.  I was always the type to get unmotivated when I fail.  And this didn\u2019t help.  I had nobody to talk to about this because my parents never supported this idea in the first place.  I stopped trying.  \nI went to college for computer science and failed miserably since I hated it and every aspect of it.  I tried business administration and also failed horribly.  After 2 years of wasting money I just gave up.  I mean why spend another dollar in college if I can\u2019t earn a single credit?  After this I started working at UPS as a package sorter.  I kept at this job and kept looking for other opportunities.  I got a job as a PA for a movie but the only reason is because I was friends w the director.  He now knows that I am pretty much good for nothing in the workplace and hasn\u2019t offered me any other positions for any other work since.  I wanted to get good at something.  I can\u2019t learn.  And now all I do is sit at home and waste my time playing video games.  And the saddest damn thing about it is the fact that I\u2019m not even good at that.  I\u2019m miserable at everything I do.  I can\u2019t even relax right. \nNow I might just be stupid but I was never good at anything.  I have no impressive cognitive skills, and lack the comprehension to get better at virtually anything.  I can barely put a cohesive sentence together without thinking I sound stupid.  I can\u2019t even explain how little I think of myself.  I\u2019m 5\u20197, so I\u2019m a tiny ass man, I don\u2019t even have looks going for me.  I\u2019m unfit, I can\u2019t run a kilometer without panting.  Im a college dropout.  I have no job.  I have no money. I\u2019m addicted to vape pens and weed.  I eat barely a meal a day.  I don\u2019t do any exercise anymore.  I\u2019ve stopped every single even SLIGHTLY productive activity that I have ever done.  I genuinely think I\u2019m the only loser on the planet that is truly this pathetic.  Hell, I almost closed this app cuz I felt too lazy to finish this post.  I don\u2019t even have motivation to clean myself, take care of myself in any way shape or form, and my family is super nice to me, I don\u2019t deserve it.  I\u2019ve made my father miserable.  I\u2019ve made my mother depressed.  Their apple of their eye and golden child is my younger sister now.  She will do amazing things I can guarantee it.  But me?  I\u2019ll rot in my room and die slow and painfully at a very young age.  I can see the light.  I just want it all to end.  There\u2019s nothing I want more than to end everything.  I hate the thoughts I think.  I hate my views on life.  I hate that I can\u2019t manage the smallest fucking task without completely burning out my willpower.  I hate that everything I do just makes things worse.  I hate that I have no help.  I hate everything.  I hate absolutely everything about my life.  I want to end it all.  That\u2019s it.  I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take it.  Every breath I take feels like a chore.  Every movement I make feels like grueling torture.  I can\u2019t pick my nose without getting tired afterwards.  There\u2019s nothing I can do about my life, except bitch and moan.  I have so many good things and yet I can\u2019t make myself appreciate anything.  I want it to end.  I want it all to end.  I can\u2019t stress this enough.\nI want this post to go viral.  So bad.  I\u2019m begging at this point.  I just need some insight from anyone that has even remotely been in my shoes.  Help me.  Please.  Someone.",

I'm about to have a conversation with my kids about my past, and I'm scared shitless of their reaction. \nI (40F) have clinical depression and anxiety stemming from some sexual abuse/assults I experienced as a child and teen. My kids (10F, 12M) know I have anxiety and depression. I obviously haven't told them the reasons behind my mental health struggles. But I have always made it a point to talk to them about my stuggles in an open and age appropriate manner. \nMy daughter is very mature for her age (mentally and physically). Lately, she's been picking up on my fears and anxieties and mimicking them. She's beginning to allow fear to hinder and hold her back. I have already begun looking for a therapist for her to see. I intend to tell her the reason I worry the way I do is because some bad things happened to me when I was younger. How much I go into explaining those bad things will be determined by a plan I put together with her therapist. At this point, I'm just waiting until she has someone to help her process the information I give her. \nI'm worried that telling her about my experiences and struggles will cause her to be even more scared. I also have a history of self-harm. My kids have no idea about this, but once I tell them, they will most certainly connect the dots and realize that's what my scars are from. I dread this part especially because I don't want them to be mad at me or scared for me.\nAny stories, advice, or information from people who've been here (either in my shoes or my daughter's) would be greatly appreciated. I feel like an idiot asking the internet about something so personal. But a therapist can't always speak from experience, so their help sometimes only goes so far.",

 "text": "Can never tell if I'm just being paranoid or not when depressed For a lot of my life I've had a history of being talked down to because of certain personal characteristics, and the fact that some people can tell I have fairly severe mental problems and so they see me as inherently childish/easy to manipulate. This has made me a pretty suspicious person and I trust very few people. To be honest, I feel like the only way to not be seen as incompetent is just to avoid speaking to people as much I can.\nOnly, when I'm experiencing my worst periods of depression, I tend to get paranoid to extreme degree and after these episodes end I can clearly see that I was blowing things way out of proportion. Like I've suspected people I know were doing everything out of spite for me personally, to make me suffer as much as possible. (Including my therapist and my own family, for ex. I once suspected my brother was somehow tracking everything I did online to spy on me) Sometimes it makes me wonder if I can ever trust my own judgement of other people again, which I think makes me even more avoidant than I otherwise would be. \nCan anyone relate? I don't think I'm psychotic because I'm never exactly \"convinced\" by the thoughts, and I know it would be beyond the pale to actually confront people about them. I just get extremely anxious that they might be true",
