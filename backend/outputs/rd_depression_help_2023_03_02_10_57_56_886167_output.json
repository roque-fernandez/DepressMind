Office because I can\u2019t function in the office because of the situation in the house hold. And I honestly idk if this job is for me because I have anxiety and social anxiety and being in an open space with so much people makes me feel uncomfortable.\nPersonally idk how people do it working especially in an office when your going through personal issues. like I have to pretend to be happy and honestly deep down I am not. And everyone is so fake sometimes I just hate this world.\nEven though I hate this world I just need to survive is there a job where I can seclude myself to just get money to get by in life",

Depression after many years becomes so comfortable that any thought of good seems unreal. \nI think the best thing to do is talk to your family. Trust what they say to you. Talk to the therapist or counselor of this pattern. Maybe writing down in a journal over and over again that you are loved you are not a burden can help. Look at yourself in the mirror and write those positive attributes to yourself. Write how you have contributed good to them. Even the smallest forms. For example i asked how they are doing, i smiled at them, i was interested and focused on the conversation we were having. These are just some suggestions. \nRemember you are not your illness, disease, disorder, etc. Your family, i am sure sees the whole person you are. They see the things you bring to the dynamic no matter how small it is. \nI don't know what they have told you but if you can have that conversation with them. I am sure they are seeing you try.",

I've been on 300mg for over a year and a half for a bipolar-2 diagnosis. \nLately I've been noticing I've been feeling relatively minor emotions much more deeply, and having pretty intense mood swings. Any small upset or \"rejection\" (cancelled plans, minor things like that) feels heartbreaking and sends me into a crying spiral, and then suddenly a few minutes later I'm out of it. \nThe other day I realized I'd forgotten to take my pills for 2 days, and noticed during that time I'd felt much more normal and stable, and hadn't been crying (or at least not nearly as much). \nIt seemed like the pills had been working for me mostly up until this point \u2014 I had more energy, more interest in getting out of bed, socializing, exercising, sex, etc.\nI switched doctors not too long ago, before this most recent bout of mood swings\u2014I haven't talked to him about that\u2014but even without that he was concerned that I'm on bupropion without a mood stabilizer. \nHe prescribed me lamotrigine but after reading about the side effects, I haven't started taking it yet.

I have worked so tirelessly through my life. I racked up so many student fees and debts to get a good education, and because of the way my government is and my workplace specialism, I can't actually get a job anymore because they pretty much don't exist. \nSo I earn next to no money. I barely make ends meet. I end up overdrawn every month, and I try and try so hard to get a better job, and I can't. I have 3 university degrees. I shouldn't be living in debt. \nI cut out non-essential payments a while ago. Got rid of TV packages, etc. I already claim as many benefits as I can to 'close the gap' between my wage and what the government classes as enough money to live on. \nAs well as this, my son has been diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, Autism and Coeliac disease all in the space of two months, and he is going through so much stress. His lifestyle has become more expensive and of course the cost shouldn't be important but when I can barely afford to heat my house, it is important. \nMy cat also passed away last week and as well as costing me almost \u00a31000 (which is equal to a month's wage), and it has left a huge hole inside of me. I've had him for so long, and he has been my rock. I feel like I've lost part of myself. \nMy boyfriend lives abroad, so I don't actually have a person here physically that I can talk to or seek support from. \nI just feel like like utter garbage. I feel absolutely useless. I can't give my son the life he deserves. I can't get the support from anyone when I need it, and I just feel like I don't know what to do. \nI am not entitled to any more financial help (again, my country has laws around benefits that make the poor people poorer). \nI just feel like so much of a disappointment. I worked so hard for years, so my life wouldn't have to be like this, and yet here we are. I kept telling myself it would pass, and I'd move onto bigger and better things, but actually, it's just getting worse as costs go up. \nI don't even know what I want out of saying this on here.

Your son's health diagnosis is tough to hear but you will find the strength to be there for him. Do whatever little you can to be kind to yourself. Sometimes you can do everything right and if times are bad, you could still end up with a tough burden to carry. Your degrees will definitely help you in future. Till then trust yourself, be your own cheer leader and keep repeating, \"This too shall pass\". You are strong. You will find a way to provide for your son. Start with talking to yourself like a good friend/ loved one would. If you have no one to support you, could you look at the mirror and remind yourself that you are awesome and you got this. I know this feels corny but this would help you more than calling yourself garbage. Your life situation is crappy right now .....you are not...Hope, faith and self belief goes a long way in this journey. \nBest of luck...rooting for you.

Having been there, and knowing a lot of others who've also been extremely close to leaving life behind or \"failed\" an attempt, these moments can truly be lifechanging for the better. The rest of your support network would be proud of you for making the decision to live as well. \nWho cares about getting everything right? We all get so messed up about that sometimes. But life is imperfect, humans are imperfect, perfect is impossible. Happiness isn't impossible. Think of all those wonderful things you do enjoy/appreciate about life. It is we who decide the meaning of our lives, our purpose, or whether purpose matters at all and perhaps we are just lucky to enjoy the experience, even in the statistical probability to be alive. I hope you can put the focus toward the things you enjoy in life instead of on the misery. Nothing is perfect man. Nothing.

Long story short, I have a friend who I've been friends with since we were 12 (I'm now a year out of college). For as long as I remember, we've relied heavily on each other for support, and there isn't a single thing about me that she doesn't know, and vice versa. Our relationship is the type where we \"trauma dump\" on each other multiple times a week with no filter and we basically are each other's therapists. I've done my best to listen, tell her that I'll always be here for her, not impose on issues that I don't personally relate to, but make sure that she knows that she's got me. But honestly, I'm worried that's not enough sometimes. Recently, I've hit a wall with how much support and help I feel I can offer her because there are issues that she brings up that I don't think I have the expertise to provide her solid advice on. I tend to take on others' issues as if they're my own, and I also feel myself building an emotional barrier, which I hate because I want to be there for her to my fullest capacity. We've always had pretty weak boundaries because we've assumed that the other can take on what we're about to tell them, but especially now, I don't think I have the expertise and capacity to help her in the way that a professional can.\nWe've been friends since we were kids and I can tell that her mental health has been severely declining, especially over the course of college and post-grad, and I don't know what to do. I'm worried because I also know that I'm the only one she talks to about these things. I don't want to lose a friend just because I didn't have the necessary skills to support her. I can tell that she's resistant to seeking professional help. I've had a therapist myself, and I was lucky to have had a good experience with it, so I know how much it could potentially help. With that being said, I completely understand that finding a therapist and speaking with a doctor is a decision that's very personal, so I don't want to force it. \nIf anyone has any advice or insight, I'd greatly appreciate it.",

 "text": "Your English is fine. A therapist helped me to understand that we all have thoughts and emotions that arise from our unconscious mind. The workings of this unconscious brain activity are largely mysterious to us. It contains all sorts of repressed memories and fragments of undeveloped thoughts. We interact with other people with our conscious mind. We can develop the conscious mind to make us appear \u201cnormal\u201d to others. When we have less external stimuli, like when we\u2019re alone or sleeping, the unconscious brain activity increases. Often the darkest thoughts and negative emotions come out at these quiet times, like wanting to die. Bringing these repressed thoughts and emotions to the surface can help us to resolve them, and create a more positive state of being. We can better integrate the unconscious with the conscious. Mental health professionals have many therapeutic approaches to help people experiencing suicidal thoughts. If you don\u2019t have access to a mental health professional, there are things you can try on your own. I\u2019ve found guided meditation to be an extremely effective technique for better understanding and integrating negative thoughts and emotions. Practicing guided meditation everyday can help you reach a level of consciousness where you can begin to understand these uncomfortable thoughts and emotions that you are experiencing. Understanding can lead to better integration and resolution. There is hope. What\u2019s making you uncomfortable does not have to define who you are. If you can, talk to a qualified professional about how you are feeling. There are many potential treatments. I pray that you find peace.",

As a patient, his experience with depression gives him some unique insights, and makes him more relatable during sessions. I\u2019m also in AA, and having a dialogue with people that have actually lived through addiction to drugs and alcohol is more valuable to me  at times than talking to a clinician that has only an academic understanding of the problem. Your experience with depression is not an impediment to providing outstanding care to your clients, it can actually enhance the therapeutic experience. You clearly care deeply about your work and the wellbeing of your clients. You will likely become stronger and somewhat less susceptible to triggers as your years in practice increase. I think your clients are fortunate to be working with you.",

I had been struggling since childhood, went through a devasating earthquake that killed most of my family members, then dealt with PTSD for years afterwards not knowing what it even was, I would stay awake for nights and skip school. All I knew it was pure hell and my relatives' reaction often made things worse (ridicule, dismissal etc.) \nI'm from a poor country and healthcare here sucks, especially mental health which automatically equals  \"schizophrenic\", that's if you can't afford a private clinic, then it's kind of okay, still, there is no cure to life. \nThis traumatic event plus being abused physically by parents at an early age obviously did not lead to great outcomes, I didn't do well in school, which again made my life worse and my prospects for the future terrible. It's difficult to explain what it's like and I'm sure others have been through worse but it's just impossible to convey to others what it's like. I'm no longer a teenager and I don't think I'm angsty neither do I hold a grudge against anyone. I used to believe in God but witnessing the cruelty, indifference and prayers not being heard made me lost a lot of it. I don't know where I want to say really, it's rare for others to be able to actually empathize with you because if you're not going through something your brain just can't imagine what it's like, all of us included, and empathy costs energy.\nI just want to get better, I'm sick of struggling and being permanently scared of the future and trying to block the past from memory, not being food/finance-secure and of all the hoops that society puts you through in order to just have a normal life. It all just says \"you're not welcome and we don't give a f*** whether you're dead or alive\", it's the 21st century and human life is really worthless, like your needs essential needs are adhoc, despite being as a species extremely advanced and having achieved great milestones.\nWhat do I do? I just need a little break from it all, I'm sick of putting on a happy face and taking the bullshit, I can't find a job despite having a degree, which means I can't look after myself and I can't get better but who cares? My existence is objectively irrelevant.\nIf I have the means I would help as many people as I can who have been in that dark hopeless place and prove that life isn't meaningless suffering, but I can't, so tough luck.\nSorry for the rant and long post, I don't usually have the stamina to rant mainly because it doesn't change anything in the end but thank you for reading this far.",

 "text": "you're doing more than a lot of people imo. You're at a good point to get yourself out of the hole, so to speak -- just judging by your description. By medication I don't know what you mean, or if you mean therapy vs meds. Therapy is usually out of price range (for me and for a lot of people) so I don't know wht to tell you there (I don't have one either and forget ever affording treatment) but as far as meds go, I always say -- order online but only IF you know what you would be prescribed. Do you wake up depressed or is it the situation? If there is PTSD then I do know that talking and writing about it helps people, with an online free group possibly? \nI wish I had an answer for you. And don't worry at all about not doing well in school. I was top of my class and it is meaningless for the future -- depending. Seriously, no one cares as long as you have the diploma. All those As I tortured myself for were and are pointless. Modern life doesn't care as much about how great you did in school. \nYou aren't alone in feeling despondent. Or not being able to afford therapy. People act like it's so easy to afford therapy or even to find a good therapist -- but I am here to tell you there are some USELESS therapists out there and there are some good ones. I know online therapists do work for free if you would be willing to try that.",

 "text": "I appreciate your input, friend. You're absolutely right in that therapy as it's commonly discussed is out of the budget of the majority of people, but it's something people say because there is no alternative. In my case, medication does work and has a good effect, it's not magic, and a lot of people have high expectations or don't know what these drugs are doing once ingested and that's fine but the problem unfortunately is bigger than a pill. I have a good plan to improve my life and \"get out of the hole\" like you said but I lack the funds and support to do so, to improve your life, you need money, to get money you need a job, to get a job you need a combination of luck/qualifications/education bla bla, some of these things are out of control so we end up being stuck and wasting time, or worse, adopt negative habits due to the lack of options. \nAnyway, thank you for the uplifting words and taking the time to reach out, it means a lot. Have a good day.",

While there are external, traumatic events, in combination with my internal belief system, that have caused my depression, I feel like after you visit that mental space, that consists of a paradigm shift, there is no way back.\nJoy doesn't feel the same. A good time with my friends is meaningless, for it ends. And after that, nothing stays. It's just me alone. \nI am really worried that after 2 years with depression and suicidal thoughts almost every day, I may never be able to fill the level of joy - without that sorrow and dark side - ever again.\nAny experiences?",

 "text": "Your internal belief system is a product of your experiences, as well as your nature. The traumatic events will also shape your belief system. \nA big thing brains like to do when you\u2019re mentally struggling is make everything feel permanent. It\u2019s a survival response, I\u2019m guessing, making you only focus on the here and now so you can get through it. \nAs you recover, your approach to your trauma will shift. Over time, that will shift your beliefs. It isn\u2019t a magical fix, but it\u2019s about more than your own mental state, it\u2019s also about your way of approaching and adapting to your mental state. Joy may never feel the same. But it certainly won\u2019t be hell. Working through these things can help return meaning to your life that isn\u2019t there right now. \nI strongly recommend seeking professional help. Be it CBT therapy, DBT, EMDR, acceptance and commitment, talk therapy, there\u2019s a lot of options, talk to a professional and see what might work for you. It\u2019s a hard road, but there will be an end. I\u2019m not there yet, but I\u2019m starting to feel it, my approach is starting to shift in some ways, and god damn is it terrifying sometimes but after so long of feeling hopeless that change and slight easing of the pressure in some moments is beautiful. \nEspecially with trauma recovery, though, it will hurt worse before it gets better. Stay strong. You can do this. Best of luck. \nSincerely, a depressed ptsd survivor",

Talk therapy is pretty basic, as is CBT, DBT can be more complex, acceptance and commitment can be helpful, and EMDR/ART therapies incorporate physiological responses into the therapy process. Ask them what they might know of, what they recommend, any new ways you can approach your therapy.
