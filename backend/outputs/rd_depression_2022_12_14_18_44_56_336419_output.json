I have better life and I\u2019m being so busy.\nBut this year since going to appointments in dentist week after week, seeing the same people I feel so awkward and just feeling so bad as if I\u2019m some sort of handicapped that people kepts on mocking. \nI don\u2019t like the feeling especially when I\u2019m already having bad life around people, roommates and everyday people I met.\nI hate this feeling that society keep want to push me to be \u201cbetter\u201d with social skills. Why can\u2019t they just understand that I\u2019m just not talkative but they think that being quiet means I\u2019m hiding some knife behind me and about to stab them all. I don\u2019t get it.\nI\u2019m struggling and stressing so much I can\u2019t seem to get any sleep. I\u2019m lacking sleep so much I feel like I\u2019m passing out at job. \nI love what I do and I enjoy it and I needed it the most. I can\u2019t lose a job.\nI used to think it\u2019ll be the easiest to finally leave when I was fired from my job because then nobody will need to see me or wonder where I\u2019d been. \nBut now that I feel like I might lost my job, I\u2019m thinking something different again to survive.\nI\u2019m so scared sometimes but sometimes I just wish there\u2019s just way for me to be happy.\nI think someone I love is taking anti anxiety or depression pills because they seem to be very happy and really really normal.\nBut to me, I\u2019ll never be normal, I was given this life to live, I didn\u2019t have friends. \nI had that one friend in high school who was trying hard to make me feel better but I lost her because I\u2019m just such a cry baby, I acted too immature for her and she\u2019s a senior and I\u2019m just a freshman, she could have been the exact person I wanted to be friends with now, but I no longer find someone like her.\nAnyways I\u2019m rambling and I need to rest my stupid head or it\u2019ll explode.\nI don\u2019t know anymore. I\u2019m overthinking. I think I dread 2023 will be very bad for me",

That\u2019s not the problem, because of my depression I\u2019ve never felt I can tell someone my problems because I don\u2019t want to pull them under my dark cloud, which I feel everyone can see. So I just internalized my anger at this dude for 2 days and now it just came out. I came out the shower so angry thinking about how I didn\u2019t say shit to this guy and that it\u2019s my parents fault I can\u2019t stand up for myself, that I was literally muttering curse words under my breath like a homeless psycho. I pass my mom in the hallway and she asks how I am ( it\u2019s just me and my mom in a small house, my dad cheated on her so she got the house in the divorce), I say \u201cgreat\u201d in a mean tone. I get in my room and start kicking my bed and just basically yeah obscenities and nasty mean things. My mom and I have been having problems, so she thinks im saying this about her, and they partly were geared towards because I know I can be a asshole to her and she kinda just has to deal with it. She come screaming in my room, like loud and angry, and I just stand there thinking these horrible thoughts about her, she leave then I kick the door hard right after she shuts it, come in screaming louder and angrier saying I have to be out in 30 days. And now I\u2019m here typing about it. If I wasn\u2019t such a depressed loser and said something to this Italian boy I don\u2019t think I would be taking it out on my mom. But I hate that I\u2019ve become this person, I hate myself so much for hurting my mom and my dad and letting other people hurt me. I want to be different, I don\u2019t want to die but I see no purpose to trying to be better, I truly believe I\u2019ll just be this depressed loser who let\u2019s people walk over him and then takes his anger out on the wrong people. What type of life is that? I feel like death is my only option. Anyways it\u2019s nice to put this somewhere, I definitely can\u2019t tell my friends about this.",
