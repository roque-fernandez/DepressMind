 "text": "I just get concerned with the posts in this subreddit sometimes... either support to not do it or just comments talking about how relatable it is to want to do it\n\nBoth of these can actually be forms of support. What we know is that a sense of alienation is one of the critical risk factors for suicide - and simply feeling less alone with suicidal thoughts decreases suicide risk.\n\nbecause out of all the things about suicide on the internet, reddit is the only place which cuts the bullshit and says that it's not gonna get any better.\n\nNot our sub's perspective at all. \"It gets better\" and \"it never gets better\" (if directed to someone else; it's perfectly okay to share one's own feelings of despair although important not to project them onto others or represent as an objective truth about the world) are both equally against the rules here. \nWhat's been found is that support that focuses on outcomes, including hope, tends to backfire and leave people vulnerable, whether or not the 'good' outcome might indeed later work out. Support that focuses on honoring what things are like for us right now, rather than dangling a carrot of hope in front of us, paradoxically turns out to be much more effective. \nUnfortunately that evidence-based info hasn't made it into much of pop culture yet, but the fact that support based in understanding rather than outcomes is rare is precisely why it's so important here.\nI hope this helps with your concern! We don't do meta posts here to keep the focus on support requests, but of course you're welcome to post your thoughts here any time or to modmail us if you have any questions or concerns about the sub.",

The comment you're responding to is spreading misinformation - any kind of involuntary rescue is a very last resort, not a first one, at a hotline, and doesn't happen except in a tiny percentage of calls. (I've also called several times for myself, also in the U.S. and never had police or anyone else sent.)\nOur hotlines FAQ /r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotline_faqs has much more info about this. Of course it's completely up to you whether you want to call, but wanted you to have accurate information!",

The horror stories get represented disproportionately online - our hotlines FAQ (/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines) has much more on this.\nThat said, please don't ever push our OPs to contact a resource or do any particular action! No one posts here because they don't know suicide hotlines/counselors/etc. exist - pushing people to do something they've already decided not to do right now (for any reason) just increases their sense of alienation and failure, which are two key risk factors for suicide. \nOur focus here is simply talking with people and trying to give understanding where they are - that is both safer and more helpful, and gives them space to decide for themselves what resources they might or might not want to reach out to going forward.",
