    "text": "AITA for not letting my husband have any of my banana bread anymore? Whenever I (29F) have bananas that are close to going bad, I like to make them into banana bread. I make really, really good banana bread.\nHowever, my husband (31M) has this complex about eating baked goods with edges. He always has to eat the middle brownie, or slice of cake, etc. So, when the banana bread is cool enough to cut into, my husband goes in and cuts out the middle 1-2 inches to eat. He won\u2019t touch any other part of the bread.\nI don\u2019t mind eating the ends, but I NEVER get to eat the middle, which is IMO the tastiest part, and worse, it causes the rest of the bread to dry out within a day (which I have to eat alone because my husband won\u2019t touch the remains of his pillage).\nKeep in mind, I\u2019m the one doing all the work to make this bread, as well as all the cleanup. \nI\u2019ve asked my husband not to do this, but he doesn\u2019t seem to care. So, I just made a banana bread, and when he asked me if it was done, I informed him he isn\u2019t allowed to have any if he can\u2019t start cutting from the end like a civilized person. I\u2019ve been living with his banana bread shenanigans for years, and I\u2019ve had enough.\nMy husband says I\u2019m being ridiculous. AITA?\nEdit: my husband has seen this post and we had a good laugh about how almost everyone took my side, much to his surprise. No guarantee he\u2019ll be changing his ways in the immediate future, but I\u2019ve been given a lot of good tips on how to get revenge, so we\u2019ll see down the line.",
