I had to move away from all my friends that I made over the past 11 years, and my ex who I still have feelings for, and apparently he still does too, but he can't deal with a long distance relationship. And he's already in a new relationship.\nIve been forced to move to a new country where I truly have no one. My parents argue every single day. My mum is stuck in a mentally, emotionally and financially abusive relationship. I have no one to talk to about my issues. Im working in a dead end job.\nTherapy helped, but it's getting more expensive and with how little I earn I can no longer afford it even with subsidies. My depression is still such a heavy, heavy thing. I can't do anything right.\nMy friends in the previous country i was in recently got into their own relationships and now they never talk to me or message me or even want to play video games or chat or something or even half an hour, or even just a few minutes. I'm always the one trying to check up on them. I understand that their relationships will take priority. But I wonder if I'm bothering them and being annoying somehow. And I am really, really, really alone and the arguments in my family make me not want to talk to them about my issues because I constantly end up being blamed for everything even if it isn't my fault. I also have a chronic health condition and even though its well controlled, I feel even more like a burden to everyone around me, its not even like people don't think like that, the people in my life have told me a few times in anger. so unaliving myself is becoming increasingly more tempting again as time passes. It's getting really hard to deal with the loneliness and my own depression. I can't get out of my bed. I can't do anything right in my life. I stay up at night wondering where everything went wrong. What did I do to deserve this.",

 "text": "I'm tired of ruining opportunities for myself and I'm tired of my habits and way of life. I get stuck in fantasy. I can walk up and down my little room completely stuck in my own head. Living out elaborate alternatives for how my life could have gone with varying degrees of realism if this had gone differently or I had just done this or whatever. Hours can go by without me noticing of just me imagining myself happy, thinking about what I could have done or who I could have been if I didn't keep fucking everything up. It really gets in the way of me taking what steps I do try to take to try to actually make it to the fantasies.\nAlso fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK sleep disorders. This whole depression thing or whatever could probably be manageable for me if it weren't for chronic insufferable sleep problems. I have tracked my sleep habits obsessively over an extended period of time over multiple lifestyles of mine and I've realized some things. When I have had long periods without deadlines or responsibilities, when I am allowed to wake up and fall asleep when I please for months on end, I have a surprising amount of clarity. I even get to a point where I start to doubt whether I even have some kind of disorder or anything like that. In these periods, my sleep schedule naturally and consistently drifts to the side at all times. One monday I'll wake up at 7am, the next I'll wake up at 2pm, the next midnight, the next 6am. It takes about a month or so for my sleep schedule to do a full 360 rotation. It's very consistent and I hardly even notice this. Its just me falling asleep whenever I want and waking up whenever I want and it feels great, really. \nBut when I have deadlines and responsibilities, and I have to be awake at 7am monday through friday every single week, is when the problems start. Its when I start having to make tradeoffs and calculations with sleep. Its when I have bursts of insomnia and hypersomnia. I can stay aligned with the socially acceptable sleep schedule for at most a week, but it just takes one little nudge to completely ruin everything very quickly. I get periods where I physically cannot fall asleep. I can stay awake in a dark room staring at the ceiling for hours and hours on end, no matter how exhausted I am. Brain just racing, stressed, annoyed, and cannot sleep. Sleep medication? Benadryl works at making me fall asleep, almost too effectively. But the problem is that it isn't a solution: its just one more thing to factor into the calculations. If I'm having an insomniac period and I take my benadryl, more often than not it will take me out for about 12 hours. I sleep through my alarm and miss one and a half morning lectures. That's fine, its better than sleeping all through the day or getting only an hour of sleep and falling asleep in the middle of the day in the library and ruining my sleep schedule in one of those ways. So now that I've slept for 12 hours, I've also shifted my sleep schedule over to the right by about 4 hours, as I've woken up later than I expected to after taking my meds late and waking up late. So now when I go through my day and its finally time for me to go to sleep, I've been awake for 10 hours only. And it's pretty hard to fall asleep meaningfully for the entire night when I've only been awake for 10 hours, especially considering my 'natural' sleep-wake cycle adds up to about 26 hours on average (meaning id have to sleep for 16 hours to match my natural sleep cycle), so I try to take my meds so I can fall asleep at all but instead I only take a 3 hour nap because I wasn't sleepy enough to fully sleep, so now I'm benadryl groggy and exhausted but wired awake at 2am and probably about to suddenly fall back asleep in about 3 hours and now my sleep schedule is really fucked. All this because of one frequent event after taking my meds. Whether I take my sleeping meds or not is irrelevant to whether my schedule is going to be fucked up, and I'm going to be missing classes missing deadlines and screwing shit up regardless. It's just one thing I need to factor into my sleep trade off calculations. And this is just one example, there are so many scenarios and events that occur in my sleep chronicle that I couldn't even recall and detail them all. Every single god damn day I have to go through this shit and it's so damn nice to just not have any deadlines and just sleep whenever I want. I've heard it all about sleep hygiene or drinking some fucking tea or whatever and none of it is a solution: its either worthless or just one extra factor in the problem.\nIt feels so fkn good to just follow my natural schedule and not have to live to the normal standard, but that doesn't fly in the world unfortunately. I'm simply incompatible with this world, I can't work with it. I don't want to enter it, I want to stay in my hole and never leave or look out or do anything. Why should I go to the world? What do they have for me? I don't need any of it. I'm at my best when I'm alone, hermited away, reading my little books and playing my little games. That is when I feel good. The stress and the pain happens when I start feeling so comfortable after not going outside for months that I decide to re-register for university or something stupid like that. I know its what I should do, in many ways its what I want to do, but I really can't handle it. I can't live up to the world. I've realized there is a disorder called 'non 24 hour sleep wake disorder' and I am completely convinced that I have to have something like this, the testimonies I read and signs and symptoms hit so close to home.",

An expensive and privileged paper weight, but useless nevertheless.\nI don't know if this is my depression taking over, but I missed work two days in a row.

They simply just did not see me as someone to have a future with. It's kind of fucked up and probably better to be alone. My awkwardness and gloominess is terrible, yeah I know. I get it. I hate me too. I always felt the lack of love in his eyes and how he never said he loved me when I would say it. And I feel like I deserved it. I deserved being used and being a stepping stone for their happiness. I can't ever be myself. I'm sorry I'm an awful person. And I'm so pathetic. For still thinking about him even though he broke up with me to date someone better. And he's probably showing her his best parts. With me, he was crying about his ex or crying about how unacomplished he feels. And always saying he doesn't love me and doesn't know if he could. And making me feel bad for not being who he wanted. Sorry I wasn't enough for you. I really loved you. I guess I thought he would change his mind but I'm an empty person. I don't love me either. I guess the biggest problem was intimacy. I'm sorry I couldn't have sex. I'm sorry I'm a broken and failed human. I really tried for you. I don't blame you for leaving. And I'm not crying that you're gone anymore. I'm crying now because I'm so alone and have always been alone. Even with you. Your breaking up with me is just a reminder of how I'm unable to have a proper relationship. I'm just someone who gets used. I just feel so broken. I see so many happy couples and it makes me feel even more alone because I never had that and never will.",

And I know I'm not the easiest person to deal with, but I don't think I'm the worst person either. \nI know my negativity eats me alive, steals my time, steals my quality of life.  My negativity just permeates through me.  I was driving yesterday thinking like... I feel like I waded through wet concrete and stopped and now it's dried and I'm stuck and I feel like part of the concrete.  I feel like someone/something poured concrete in me and I can't move, therefore, I don't know what the point is.  I'm here but I can't do anything.  I can't will myself to do anything because there is no point.  I type on here because I can't talk about this with anyone.  \nI wish I knew why I'm here.  I wish I knew if I was good.  I don't feel like a good person.  I don't think I am a good person.  I carry a lot of negative thoughts about people.  I'm so judgmental of other people.  I'm so angry at people.  I'm so sad at people.  I feel dumb.  I feel unattractive.  I feel juvenile.  I feel blank.\nWhy am I here?  I feel like I'm blowing it.  I feel like I'm wasting time with whatever it is I'm supposed to be doing here.  I'm not good at life.",

Last time I tried it was a long waitlist. \nMy depression is fluctuating a lot, my anxiety is easily triggered and I feel mostly shame. For everything and nothing. I cry a couple times a day, except when I can feel nothing. Or it just doesn\u2019t reach the surface. \nI have a meeting about work at one of my jobs next week, cause I have been gone more than present, just constantly being sick it seems. So maybe I\u2019ll lose my job. And I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do then. \nI seem to often disappoint my family, my job, and anyone else that looks at me.",

Now I\u2019ve been doing the same except o don\u2019t take anything before doing 2 tasks. Like doing my laundry and dish, or picking up trash and cleaning something. But this only solves my productivity. \n\nI don\u2019t do anything like go out with friends, unless we are going to someone\u2019s home. I don\u2019t have alot of spare money and I don\u2019t want to have to sell my car. The thought of that fucks me up, I know it\u2019s a car but I spent 3 years searching. I have a hard time relating to new people I meet sense I don\u2019t care for typical sports, music or movies. So idk how to talk to them.\nI want to get a degree so im doing something I like, but idk how it would be possible as I don\u2019t have financial freedom. And im old now, is 5 years of school worth it? Im still weighing it out. \nIdk im just ranting, typing it out is quite therapeutic to me.",
