 "text": "Why is cancer so hard to cure? Cancer is when one cell malfunctions, and it causes that one cell to multiply rapidly. This makes no space for healthy cells. Having a large clump of cells in one area can form a cancerous area, they can sometimes be seen as small lumps. When they are seen as lumps, the cancer is already fairly well developed, or in a later stage. Therefore, it is very difficult to identify a cancer, which is the first issue\nThere are three main treatments. Surgery is where doctors try to remove the cancerous area.. Radiation is when doctors will use lasers to remove the cancerous cells. For both of these to be successful, the cancer must have been identified rather early on. The final treatment is chemotherapy, which is where you will take something that will kill a portion of cells in your body. It kills the cancerous cells, but the healthy ones too, which is why chemo patients will have hair fall out, vomit, feel nauseous, etc. Chemo is also not very specific, so it\u2019s almost like a roll of a dice. You have to use it multiple times to succeed, and even then it\u2019s not guaranteed. Patients also cannot take chemo every day,  so they have to wait awhile between takes. This gives time for the cancer to grow\nThere are many, many, many different types of cancer. Even if we succeed at finding a way to cure breast cancer, lung cancer will have a different cure. Again, this is is because cancer is not a virus, it is not something you can catch, it happens directly in the cells\nThanks for reading, hope this clarifies things",

The launch is cool, but the stuff at the end is kinda bland. Overall it\u2019s fun ride, but CR is much better",

Even though Mark messed with you, it\u2019s clear that hiding his bracelet  wasn\u2019t intended as a \u2018fun prank\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t say revenge is the right word, but something in that ballpark \nIt\u2019s rarely ok to do stuff like that, despite how someone was treating you\nHowever, this Mark guy sounds like an awful friend, and you need to cut ties as quick as possible. I know it\u2019s hard, and it won\u2019t be easy, but this is the beginning of a toxic relationship, and you can\u2019t get stuck in that\nIt\u2019s clear that all those things Mark has done (pranks, teasing, etc) have annoyed you and angered you. You shouldn\u2019t tolerate that. Yes, you were friends with him in first semester, but it\u2019s not first semester anymore. You shouldn\u2019t have hid his bracelet, but I think the more concerning part of this post is how you\u2019ve just let Mark treat you like that for however long, and you didn\u2019t speak up at all\nHope this helps!",

But Epcot also has a world showcase, where you can \u2018walk around the world\u2019 and explore countries cultures, food, and just learn some stuff about them.

So I decided to make a list\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve never watched the James Cameron film, Go To Pandora World of Avatar. I have never watched the movie and I love that place \nBe aware that Navi River is a short ride\nFlight of Passage uses 3-D glasses, so be aware if you have trouble with that\nDinosaur is freaking scary. It\u2019s not a roller coaster, but it\u2019s scary.\nKali River Rapids is not very god in my opinion. If it\u2019s a short wait, go for it, but if it\u2019s more than a half hour, come back later. If you do ride, be aware that you will get wet.\nExpedition Everest is also scary. It\u2019s an amazing roller coaster, but can be quite terrifying. The ride has a single rider line, which is where you and your group will be split up. If you guys are ok with being apart, do single rider. You\u2019ll get on so much faster\nFestival of the Lion King is amazing, and I highly recommend seeing it.\nIf you are going with little kids, in Dinoland, there is a place called Dino Dig Site. This is like a little playground where your kids can run around and burn of some energy \nNo matter what, do the Safari. It\u2019s amazing. No matter what time you go, you\u2019ll always see plenty of animals.\nI know this list is long but hopefully this helps",

It\u2019s clear this \u201crelationship\u201d won\u2019t last long, and if it grows into something else, well, there\u2019s no real way to prevent that. You can worry about that when it comes. Your friend obviously won\u2019t listen and is practically blind in this situation. Therefore there is no point in trying to get through to her. Try not talking to her as much, as doing so seems to bring you distress. And if that guy tries to approach you in anyway, simply don\u2019t engage. It will only cause more problems.

One time my mom got super mad at me, and I got to the point where I had a knife in my hand and was just staring at it. I don\u2019t know what did it, but there was a little spark inside me that wouldn\u2019t let me do it. For some reason, I kept fighting. I understand that anger you\u2019re going through. It\u2019s unbearable, isn\u2019t it? Life is just so mean to us. Some people are born with different strengths and weaknesses. It can feel really unfair. And it is. But it can get better. Not overnight, obviously, but it can get better. You just have to keep fighting. Push through until you collapse, and keep on going. This world is cruel and unfair, but we might as well try and live a good life. Keep going. SOMEWHERE INSIDE YOU, THERE IS A TALENT,AND A PURPOSE, just waiting to unleash itself. Keep fighting, stay strong. I may be some random stranger on the internet but I hope this reasoned with you and you\u2019ll consider changing your mind.",
