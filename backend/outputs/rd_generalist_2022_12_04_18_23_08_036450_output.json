    "text": "Congrats to our first 1000 subscribers! We are on track to being the default hub for Nikke content on Reddit. I will always fondly remember when one of the mods over there said \u201cno one cares about your stupid little subreddit\u201d.  Well, slight correction: it\u2019s not my stupid little subreddit anymore, it\u2019s ours.  \nWe\u2019re going to be adding some full mods, a CSS wizard, and if you\u2019re handy with setting up automod let me know!  I\u2019d love to have an expert on that.  We\u2019ll also be debuting the first megathreads in a few days including team comp questions.  \nThere\u2019s a lot of great reasons why that other sub shouldn\u2019t be trusted any longer - even if they weren\u2019t censoring, the aggressive way they deleted every single post and told people to use megathreads was extremely off-putting.  I agree that a sub shouldn\u2019t be overrun with too many shitposts, but let the community police that through downvotes unless it starts to take over.  And now they have a single critical topic up, but how long until they start cracking down again?  \nThe worst thing of all is being outright banned from there for \u201cinciting hate\u201d.  What the fuck does that even mean?  If someone is breaking Reddit ToS or calling for harm or harassment of individuals, then yeah - that\u2019s inciting hate.  We won\u2019t stand for that here either.  But saying that it\u2019s potato-on-head fucking stupid that it\u2019s even possible to go 150 pulls with no SSR in this game, or that a Pilgrim mold gives a fifth of people who use it an R-class Nikke is not \u201cinciting hate\u201d.  It\u2019s airing grievances.  \nWe love this game.  Obviously.  Why else would I spend my time on obscure forums for a game unless I was head over heels for it?  But also we aren\u2019t suckers and we know what good gacha management is - and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to call out poor decisions by the publisher or inexcusable bugs by the devs.  They made $70 million last month - let\u2019s see them put that to good use and give the fans the things we need and want.  \nThank you for being here - you are appreciated.  And though I am sure the mods of this subreddit will have to occasionally delete things, I hope to do it with a light touch and only when absolutely necessary.  \nWelcome commanders!  This Outpost has a glorious future with all of us leading the charge.",

    "text": "Additionally I want to add that I know a lot of the content on this board is airing grievances with the other subreddit right now.  \nAnd I think that\u2019s normal and healthy.  After all, when you get out of an abusive relationship, you can\u2019t truly begin to heal until you are allowed to express yourself and the injustice you\u2019ve experienced.  \nSo I would expect that for a short time we will still see a lot of people outraged over the other subreddit (which I will not name here).  But over time I hope we begin making the transition to posting gameplay tips, interesting leaks, fan art, and other discoveries.  \nYou can help by creating and linking (and writing!) interesting and positive content, and making sure to submit it here exclusively!  Thanks for all your continued support.",
