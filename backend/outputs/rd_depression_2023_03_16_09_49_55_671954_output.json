 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "I've been crying a lot this past month thinking about my ex. We didn't always get along and she got really irrational whenever she was mad, or perhaps more accurately was sometimes irrational and became mad. I started to understand why. Even with the arguments we talked about kids, and retirement. We talked about the price of mortages and calculated how much money we could have in retirement if we saved and assumed 7% or 10% YOY growth in the stock market (seems questionable now haha). We talked about where we would put money and split up personal recreational spending. We talked about daycare and where the kid would go during the summer and how my parents would help take care of them. I just want to talk to her and see if we can work this out now that I have the money.  \nI caught rona this week. It's fine. I'm getting travel fatigue anyways. I was originally planning to go to Japan but I'm just so tired of it. Every city in the fucking world is 90% the same with slight differences like language, public transportation, the niceness of the people, and cost of living/wages.  \nWas talking to another girl. But Rona prevented our date. Due to Visa news yesterday I won't be staying here very long so I won't be able to see her for probably a month except maybe this weekend. But I don't know if it's just a waste of her time since I don't know if I'll be able to come back and it'd only be for up to 2 months. \nStill planning to visit my extended relatives.  \nI haven't exercised for the past 2 weeks or so. I couldn't find gyms the first week, only places selling equipment, and the second week the gym only had 6 month membeships. Oh well I'm getting enough from walking and dancing. Drinking a lot at open bars.",

I still blame myself for everything that ended my marriage because I couldn't just simply talk about things. Because I kept trying to find my answers at the bottom of a bottle. I ruined the most wonderful thing to ever happen to me like I do everything else. Hard to escape that feeling when its all you can think about. \nWhen you wake up and your soft bed feels ironclad, your pillows like concrete and you're stuck in the prison that is your own mind. I see no self worth, or reason to keep trying, but trapped in the revolving door of keeping going for those around me. I don't want to anymore. Not waking up sounds like the perfect way out but personally feels selfish to me at the same time. Is it weakness? Does it make me a coward? I have no idea, I just dread the night and despise the day and wish there was a clear answer. \nThe help....isn't helping.",

It's been half a year since he cut ties with me, and I still love him and miss him. He could care less and is happier with someone else. I guess he was never mine in the first place, he basically admitted to just stringing me along because he was lonely and liked the attention I gave him. That makes me sad because I really thought I meant much more to him, but it was all lies. I really hate it. I'm just a miserable bitch, it's no wonder he left me. He wants to act like nothing happened between us and showed up to where our friends were and I just left. I don't want to be around him when he's happy with someone else. I guess that makes me an awful human. I just feel so unlovable and broken. I'm never good enough. I wish I were dead. And the most fucked up thing is that I feel guilty for taking some of his friends. It's not that I purposely did anything. His wonderful new gf completes him. Haha.",

 "text": "The nights are the worst, in the dark only myself and my thoughts. Without divulging too much information I am a 30 yo man, Large, capable ( or at least I used to be ) Physically fit as you'd expect a 30 year old to be. I have struggled with my vices and my emotions, my mental health and well being for a very, very long time. \nRecently, less than a month ago, my wife left me. The typical reasons I guess. The depression, and anxiety driving a wedge between us, the drinking to suppress the feelings and the sadness, eventually leading to us growing apart and I blame myself entirely. She struggled with making the decision and I more or less pushed her to that point. I am having a hard time not being angry at myself, or talking to myself in some pretty disgusting ways. \nI have never been a fan of counseling, or therapy. I guess I have never been put in touch with a good therapist or had a good experience with any. I bury everything as deep as I can but eventually it all comes to a head and explodes. Never violently, but loudly and abruptly. The night she left me we stayed in the same house and for the first time in our marriage we slept in different rooms, I didn't sleep admittedly but stared at a bottle of bourbon for 6 hours. She went to work the next morning, active duty military so she didn't have a choice. I quit my job, packed my few belongings and drove the 1760 miles back home. \nSince that night I haven't drank a drop, dealing with everything sober has been an experience all its own, but I can't help but feel me slipping into the dark places my mind has always gone. I had planned a suicide in great detail years ago and she came along just mere days before I was planning to do it, hell, I even told her that once. I'm scared...I used to be a mountain of a man and now I can't escape feeling like a pile of rubble. I don't want to be here, I don't want to feel that way. How do I curb it? How do I find the desire in me that I know is there but hiding? I am strong, I am intelligent, I can be all the self affirming things in the world but these characteristics  seem to disappear when the darkness starts looming again. I posted on reddit because it feels safer than a face to face. I need help, I just don't know what help....",

It's naive for me to assume the world is against me though tit feels that way sometimes. You would think statistically one could get a win now and then. Dealing with things like this repeatedly you start to think you are the problem and in most cases that is exactly the truth.

(read: you 'will' join that)\". \nCurrently in such a bad state. Feel like crying the entire day, just trying to somehow hold things together. Now trying to mentally deal with this as well. The date was just a few days away. I was just skipping the article cause couldn't really deal with it, I missed that you had to write them an email before to sign up. I have so much anxiety and I'm so bad with anything red tape, signing up, committment etc. It's worse because it's a skype conference. I got nightmarish visions where they're adressing you by name and want you to talk about this stuff and whatever else. Writing this at the middle of the night, it's a few hours away in the morning. \nAnd no matter how it went I have to report to my parents afterwards and somehow act like all of this was totally productive. All of this assuming that they still send me an invite tomorrow morning. Otherwise idk what I'm supposed to say. \nCan't deal with any of this.",

 "text": "Lately I've been feeling more alone and isolated than I have in a long time.  I get out and go to social activities and talk to people, but there's this feeling I can't shake, I feel like nobody really cares to be around me and that I'm kind of just a background character.  Like maybe people might enjoy talking to me at the weekly events I go to, but nobody really wants to get to know me or be around me beyond that.  I can put myself out there, but I'm struggling to turn that into real genuine connections.\nIt's something I've always dealt with, but it's also gotten worse in the last year or so.  A while ago I had developed a fairly close friendship with someone who ended up blaming me for their breakup (it ended for reasons entirely unrelated to me) and they said some really awful things.  I didn't really realise this until relatively recently, but that event honestly kind of broke me - I'm sort of realising that in the last year in particular I've felt a lot of cynicism and paranoia towards forming new connections and I think a lot of it stems from that event.  Even if I get past the persistent feeling that someone don't like me, I still feel disposable, like they'll just drop me as a friend and stop talking to me for some reason, or blame me for something.  I've had this happen to me a few times and it's always felt awful but I think the event I mentioned was a bit of a turning point for me because it was someone I thought I had a particularly genuine friendship with.  It's such a rare thing to find, but it can end so easily and in ways you can't even control or predict.  It's so crushing.\nAnyways, there's my midnight rant.  I just feel so completely alone in life and every day feels harder than the last.",

There's a thousand and one reasons I have depression relating to every poor way my parents \"parented\" me growing up from the neglect of my dad and blatant abuse of my mom and grandfather. But the thing that drove me up a fucking wall today was, my grandmom retired recently and she can't find anything to keep her busy so she just keeps fixing random crap around our house that doesn't need fixing, and bugging the rest of us. I suggested she journal, read, or write a story, she thought it was a good idea, so I went down into our basement guest room where I have a lot of my things stored from college still, to find her a book. And it was re-arranged when my grandparents retired so my grandfather could work on his coin collection. I walk into the room and see my stuff re-arranged. Oh well, as long as it's there neat I'm cool with it. Then I turn around and see the 5 journals I kept through the 3 years of college I had, lined up next to a bunch of old school work and art work my uncle made when he was a kid that my grandmom and mom have been reading and laughing over. So I have this irking and explosive rage building up in me right now that's there because I feel it's pretty obvious that my mom and grandmom have been reading my private shit. It's making me want to explode and yell at them all right now, but I know they'll just try and gas light me and spin on me that I'm the bad guy. I know the easy answer is \"its their house, they can do what they want, move out\", and I've heard it before. But I am trying to move out, it's difficult, and even if I am living here, I bought those journals, and I wrote them when I was living at school, that doesn't give them the right to invade my privacy. And if I haven't mentioned this already the reason I'm so paranoid is because my mom has read my journal without my consent before, during covid, when I was at a really low place with depression working my ass off to pass online physics and chemistry classes that are impossible enough in person and I was going crazy studying extra hours online to pass. And she took everything I wrote out of context, and even though she was barely even mentioned in my journal entries, she decided to take the whole thing personally and cause more problems for me by calling me selfish and starting more fights. I think she's bipolar or borderline personality, because I flipped out at her to never do that again or I'd leave the house and stop talking to her, and she did it again after a few weeks, so I started leaving threats in my journal to hurt her, knowing she'd disobey the one thing I ask of her, hoping she'd stop, but she just started more shit, and then suddenly started leaving weird fake sentimental notes in my journals and always found them no matter where I hid them, as if that would somehow absolve her of the fact she's invading my privacy, insincere apology written in a book your forbidden to write in or not, that's still going against the one thing I ask her not to do, so I followed through and I left mid-way through covid and lived with my dad until move in day the following semester at college, barely speaking to my mom. Then I move back in with her after college and a year goes by, nothing bad except a few arguments, and now we're here, where I see all of my journals removed from where I put them, all neatly stacked in ORDER BY YEAR, making me believe she STILL went against my wishes and read my shit. \nWhat can I do about this until I can move out? I don't want to bring this up to her or my grandparents because I don't want to deal with my mom starting shit and making me feel bad for being born at the moment. And I'm not on good terms with my dad either (long story short he ran off and started a new family with an abusive woman who treated me and my sister like garbage) so I can't just simply up and move there. This is just the tip of the ice berg on how my family has treated me, there is much worse out there that they've done in my life but this is the most recent thing. And I feel really bad saying this but, I've never been a violent person, I've never wanted to hurt anyone nor have I ever attempted to without reasonable cause (self-defense), but I catch myself wishing my family would just all up and die some days, like since I can't get out yet it feels like the only relief I'll get is them all just permanently shutting up. When I finally get to move out I'm just going to cut her off as well as my grandparents and maybe my dad (I say maybe because I still have young half siblings living with him that I would like to be able to know), but for now the only feelings I have for them is dread and the horrifying desire for them to just stop existing. I don't know how to handle this anger, I just know that it's going to eat away at me until something bad happens, like an early life heart attack or something, my blood pressure is already high for my age and it's only gotten higher because of the stress and anger my family causes, I don't know what to do.",

 "text": "So I'm graduating university soon, honours and everything. It's a huge achievement and everyone is congratulating me and telling me I ought to be so proud of myself.  Since I have horrible mental health, it was a real struggle to get through - there were so many sleepless nights, breakdowns and I pushed myself to my absolute limit on many occasions. So reaching the end should be a pretty big victory.\nWhen I started uni, I was basically a recluse who didn't know how to talk to people and had zero social life. However, through a combination of therapy, medication and just how easy uni makes it to socialise, I managed to really come out of my shell. I became the president of a campus social club. Went on a lot of dates. Made some friends. Worked on some really interesting projects. Hell, I even started dressing well. I've been told I'm practically unrecognizable compared to the way I was when I started. It's a real success story. University doesn't necessarily make anything easier, but it makes the opportunities to improve more accessible - want to make friends? Here's a specific event you can go to this week filled with people that have similar interests. It sets you up for success, if you can push yourself to go for it.\nSo after saying all that, you may be wondering what I'm doing here. The problem is, I feel like the only part of my life that's ever mattered is over. These past years have been so eventful and vibrant, and I'm only just realising that now that it's ending. Sort of like how you don't realise when the good old days are until they're over.  What am I even supposed to do with myself now? Nothing will ever be as exciting, and all the social opportunities I enjoyed are going to be much fewer and far between. It might seem silly to be sad about literally achieving my goals, but the university lifestyle is just so dynamic and interesting and I don't want it to end.\nA few people know that I've been struggling with this, but I don't think anybody realises the full extent.  I feel like I've been wearing a mask. A few months from now when I step up onto that stage and accept my degree, it feels like my life will be over.  Like if I ended things right there, that would be fine and I would have ended up a high note. For a while I didn't even want to end things anymore, but now I'm starting to feel that way again.\nI feel worse than I have in ages and it's because I turned myself around and am close to achieving something I've been working towards for a long time. Sounds silly when I say it out loud. But it's how I'm feeling right now.",

I already had to go to the hospital twice for a chest drain which was not a very pleasant experience. I however don't get why because everything went well and everyone was so nice, but I am still terrified. I know I have had it happen more than twice because I have felt the same symptoms multiple times on other occasions, but I am to scared to do anything. But because it happened twice already the chance of it happening again is big and everytime it happens there advice for an operation is stronger, which greatly decreases the chance. This time  I said I said I will wait till next time and get the operation then. I am still scared though, but I also want it to be over so badly. One of the reasons I said no this time is because for a while now I haven't felt great, which stupid enough I am also too scared to say to anyone. But at the moment I am also so scared I will get it again now, which wants to make me get the surgery just to get over with it.",
