 "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.\nIn addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  \nIf you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers\u2019 problems.",

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement.

It happens sometimes at my IRL crisis line, most often because they've never had a supportive conversation before they talked to us, so they kind of \"imprint\" on us (we literally call them \"ducklings\").  It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

I\u2019m still trying, but it seems as if it\u2019s not enough. \nToo rational, too cold, too calculated, even more than before. I don\u2019t and can\u2019t subscribe to the \u201cthings will magically work out somehow\u201d mentality. That\u2019s not how I live. There's so much luck you can have before it runs out. The fact that I have a roof over my head and can still support myself now is because I had an exit strategy back when I started college in case I wouldn\u2019t want to continue with the major after graduating, not because some mysterious being pitied me and decided to help me. Guess I\u2019m still bitter over those thinly veiled dehumanizing beliefs I was fed with, which now looking back on this, were not subtle at all. How could I not? All you can see was how I went from being a fundamentalist to an ex-religious in less than two weeks, two months, or three months. But how would you have known anything about the process that led up to it, the struggle, doubting, questioning, fighting and deceiving myself, and leaving the foundation, the things, the people who I held dear most to my life? I\u2019d already left my family of origin\u2014the first people who were supposed to love and accept me. Of course it\u2019d stink the second time. \nPerhaps being empty-handed is a good thing. There\u2019s no meaning to anything. No sign. No fixed future destination. Which is exactly why I\u2019m free to do anything. Be a good person because I wanna do it, not because of the desire of eternal rewards. Allow myself to slip up and not constantly thought police myself.   \nIsn\u2019t this freeing?",

I have no distraction; media helps at times, but then I'm back to reality, back to the pain. I am currently unemployed and looking to apply to multiple jobs, but barely hearing anything back or getting a fucking interview makes me just want to throw in the towel. I wish things were different, and I wish I was different, but I'm not. Everything, even the smallest event to others, is amplified to me. I am pushing because I genuinely want to reach peace one day, but the work to get there is just mentally and physically tiring. I've isolated myself from a lot of people and definitely ruined friendships and relationships because I'm rotting inside. I don't want to go out to hang with friends anymore because I hate being in public more than anything, and pretending to be happy and present almost feels like I'm being overly fake. I'm tired. I'm exhausted with life, and my life in particular. I'm trying to take things one day at a time, but I don't know how much time I have. Holding on, holding on.",

Things were fine until I messed it all up again because that's all I ever do with friendships and deep personal relationships, I inevitably fuck things up and drive people away.

Entitled kid who wanted to cut off the edges on bread since he couldn't eat those. I guess leaving him the majority of the junk food for 9 years because he ate nothing else contributed to this entitledness.  \nSo I don't have many people to talk to since my brother is a judgemental narcissist.",

No friends, no memorable experiences, no long term happy relationship, no career to speak of it. I've hardly done anything with my 20's. I can't believe it. I hate the phrase \"you're so young, you still have time\". Yeah, I used to think that, and now I'm still in the same position as when all those people used to say that to me. Now I'm not so young anymore. Thinking that I was 'still young' was a mistake. It just causes you to slack and not try as hard to change circumstances because \"well, i have time, i'll do it tomorrow, next week, next month\". No, you don't have time. Time is the most expensive thing and you never get it back. All the experiences I dreamed of having when I was younger, that I was gonna become a beacon of my community and change lives... lol even just simple things like wanting to walk around the mall with a friend or watch a movie with someone, all my dreams are dead and buried. High school me would've been so disappointed. I would've killed myself back then if I knew I'd be where I am now.\nAnyway, trying to get into a new jobfield. I'm upset and annoyed that I've been waiting since August to work with this company, but I still have 2 interviews to do and then 3 weeks of training, only if I pass the interviews (and now I have to spend money on interview clothes). I won't be able to start working until December, maybe January. I just thought the process would be quicker but now it's gonna take so long. I need money now. This whole process is slowing me down and I'm extremely antsy, haven't been employed since July 2022 I'm so bored just being in the house all day, nothing excites me and I can't afford to do anything. It is so stressful being a human. I wish I didn't have to do any of this stuff. I don't even know what I'm doing it for either. I'd be getting a job just to help me continue to survive... but I don't like living. I don't want to make money to keep living longer. I guess the solution would be to starve... I hate this world so much, I hope for more climate disasters to come and hopefully Earth will the finish the process of exterminating us wretched humans who don't appreciate mother Earth, we just take from her, hoard, and make things worse for our fellow human.",

 "text": "I got into an argument with my 23 year old brother. He's been really selfish lately since when I ask him to talk or drop me off somewhere or anything really small he's always making excuses for why he can't do it. He'll say he'd rather not, or he's not good at talking to people, or my room is too messy and so is his if I ask for someone to talk to. Barely see him despite living next door to him. I'm much older and watched over him when he was younger all the time, giving him his bottle, even occasionally helping change diapers.  \nRecently I asked if I could use his curry to make some curry (with vegetables I bought). He said no, since he'd have to buy more. I thought of this as a last straw. He's always critical of whatever I do. But fuck there's empty toilet rolls on the ground in the bathroom and have been for months even before I arrived. He's not some paragon of a person himself, can't even bring it outside the bathroom to the trash.  \nI said fine I won't use his curry but not to eat the food I buy. He eats pb and j or whatever desserts I buy. Then he tried to say that I can't use the family's white car, that our parents own, because he uses it for work. He's been really possessive about the white car, the only one he's willing to drive cuz he's a spoiled little shit, for years. Wants to take it if he moves out but I know he probably won't move out. My parents don't bother him nearly enough.  \nWhen we go dragon boating he says it's ok to drive there after we'd decided to go by public transit but only if I drive. He's always trying to get out of doing any work. He just doesn't want to drive or pay for parking. He tries to get me to fill up the gas tank even being so spiteful as to come back with a near empty tank since he accuses me of always using the car. The thing is, and I argue this, I mostly only use it for local trips 2 miles away, not hour long commutes to work.  \nBut whatever it's only $40 I go fill up the tank. He wants me to fill up the white car half the time. The car that was supposed to go to me. But he's the one who uses it like 70% of the miles, my mom using 20%, and me another like 10%. How is this fair?  \nHe says I can't eat anything he makes anymore. And then threatens me with an \"are you sure you want to go down this route?\" Honestly I'm not sure if this is even worth reconciling. He's my brother, we don't choose our brothers. And I don't even know how we turned out so different. Genes probably. I can never get away from him being my brother but I sure can limit how much I talk to him.  \nHe's 23. All these years of me giving him the good room, him giving me the shitty chair he broke, always leaving more desserts and junk food for him when we were younger because I know he liked them, taking him to the park, giving him only compliments and trying to help him, getting into games to try to play them with him, teaching him science, playing with him daily, letting him use my laptop from games when I got back from work during internships. Sharing it when we were younger and giving him more time. And now I find out he's just a prick who doesn't care about any of it.  \nWhat do I do? If it were a friend I'd just cut the toxicity out of my life. Perhaps I let him get away with too much. Perhaps my mom let him become transactional when he was younger and that somehow developed into his narcissistic personality.",

For me it feels like things whirl around faster and closer to me until I can't handle it, but finding the correct medications has slowed that down a little bit. I am in a not great spot right now, but I know if I take my adhd medication it will bring me out of the not wanting to be alive times for a while. I have to take anxiety meds everyday though. Idk sorry for just talking about myself in response. I am on the long term disability application roll, and I'm hoping I can get it this time. I highly recommend just trying that, especially if you have doctors who will back you. It's hard because I am guessing you mask your audhd (I do this too) and it makes things so much worse for us, but more palatable for others. I'm trying to unmask right now, and the more comfortable I get with unmasking the less I hate myself and want to go away forever. I haven't been able to hold a job down for 5 years. I can work for about 6 weeks and like you I burn out in that time. I'm going to try and work 1 day a week, and am really crossing my fingers on disability. It's taken me a long long long time to see my situation as disabling, because I can still feed myself sorta, but the fact is that we are disabled and need more support. Blaaaaaah my brain is fuzzy tonight, but if you want to talk at all I'm all ears. The suffering is real and idk, tv is nice. Do you have any pets?",

Yes it's subjective, so popular opinion may be wrong, but if 100% of people think you're bad at drawing (which is absolutely possible), then by all useful measures you are. \nIt's not about being the best it's about being good. If you do a really good drawing, it doesn't matter if Monet is a better drawer than you, you're good in your own right. That's where subjectivity does come into it, like is Tarantino a better director than Spielberg? It doesn't matter because they're both very good and do their own things. Even when you don't like good directors, you can still recognise the skill and talent behind their appeal. But if you're not good, and you never seem to get good, it really really sucks. When it comes to arty things, a huge function of their purpose is to entertain or be valuable to other people.",

 "text": "I know the feeling. Lots of positive comments here, but the truth is not everyone can be good at what they love. It's really so so depressing when you're not. I have loads of different creative hobbies like music, writing, photography, calligraphy, among others. And I'm really obsessed with them, I love them so much and know so much and have a lot of skill about it. Sometimes I'm even pretty good or impressive at them. But I've never made anything that's actually GOOD good, like those people who can just do an amazing drawing and other people look at it and go wow that's so good. Or a song that's actually worth listening to. Like I know so much about music production and have really good skills with it, and I can design synth sounds and make a song and it will be like cool that I can do that, but it's SO so far from the magical feeling you get when you hear an amazing song, it's just like meh music production is cool but the song is not entertaining, not worth anything to anyone else. But I just want to be really good at something so I can create something that has value to other people, to share my unique take on the world in a way people relate to, that's what all these creative things are about.\nPeople are like just have fun that's all that matters don't worry what people think, van gogh never sold a painting, blah blah. However that's just motivational nonsense. Yes enjoying it is necessary to get good, but being able to make something other people value is the reason why things like music, stories, etc exist. It's their primary function, they exist to entertain other people. A work of art that cannot entertain anyone but the artist is worthless, and that's just the way it is. \nAnyways, what I will say is that you can always improve, if you work REALLY hard you may be able to get good at anything you want to, but you'll have to work much harder than a talented person who can just do it, which absolutely sucks, takes a lot of fun away, and isn't super realistic for most people, everyone wants to learn piano but how many non-talented people actually have the time and energy to reach the highest standard? No one. \nI think a lot of talent is just circumstantial, a small genetic component, but the biggest thing is starting young. You have to do the thing a LOT to get good, so when kids start in childhood, they can have 10 years of experience by the time they're 14. They already did all the terrible drawings as a child, they learnt to draw while their brains were developing, so they get good at a very young age and it becomes part of their brain on a deep level and they keep improving and reach god mode in their teens. You can probably do the same thing as an adult but it's harder because life gets in the way and 10 years of experience goes much quicker if it's from your childhood. It's even hard in your teens, but after 20 it becomes hard work where in your childhood it is really just effortless fun. That's why a lot of talented people are so good, they've got loads of experience, maybe even their entire lifetime, and that's something you can't catch up with. \nBut anyway, the only reasons left to keep going are to improve and to have fun. Both are good reasons. A year ago I decided to give up up trying to be good at music production because I just realised it wasn't worth the pain and torment of constant disappointment and I'm just not that talented. However I still go back to it every now and again, I don't even want to but it's something I like doing and it just seems to happen, I can't stay away from it. I feel like it's a part of who I am, which is depressing because I suck, but I still try. And doing it just for fun without pressuring yourself to be good, allowing yourself to be bad, make the whole thing so much more enjoyable. It's not easy though. Of course we all want to be good. Again, that's the whole point of music. That's the point of anything you put work into. Life isn't fair, it sucks. I am so so so sad that I'm not talented enough to create something that other people want to be a part of their life. I'm a jack of all trades and master of none, but it does feel pointless. I want to master something because I know I work as hard and love the things I do as much as the very best artists. I am still hoping I can learn to be good at something though so I keep trying.",

 "text": "If this is the first time OP told her friend about her suicidal thoughts, it's definitely not okay to not care. But if this happens often, it might be a case of helper's fatigue. Especially if all advice or suggestions of getting professional help were ignored in the past. Then that friend might be burnt-out and feel like they have nothing left to give.  \nI married a person with BPD and frequent suicidal ideation. It can be totally exhausting and the only way to make it work is by having a network of support (professional, family and friends). If I was the only person to take care of her when she's in a bad place, I'd be completely burnt-out within days.  \nNow, when the ideation is bad enough to write a note, it may just be time to head into a facility. Both my wife and I have been there and if you go voluntarily, it's not as bad as movies make it out to be. And for me, the weeks in there and getting on the right meds actually helped a lot. The friend could/should definitely offer to help pack a bag and get OP to the closest crisis centre, even if they don't have the time or the means to stick around all the time. (Where that crisis centre is and what happens next depends on where they live.) But if OP has a history of refusing to go or checking out before the treatment even had a chance to work, I'd understand why they wouldn't voice the offer this time.  \nSo it's definitely true that not caring is bad, but depending on the history between them, it may be a sign that the friend is not able (physically and/or psychologically) to care anymore, not that they never cared or are not willing to help according to their own means.",

I was a great athlete in highschool and even went on to play a division 1 sport. I had so many friends in high school and always felt like I was happy. In school, I am smart, when I study or actually apply myself I do good. But theres the first of my many issues. I graduated with a degree in Health Sciences with around a 3.0 GPA. I always dreamt of becoming a doctor or at least a PA. But since I was so focused on sports and social life. My  gpa is doomed. I would basically have to retake 4 years of college to get my GPA near what it needs to be to become a doctor or PA. I stress about this everyday. I am currently working as a physical therapy aide at a hospital and I love it. However, this can not be my career because of how much i make. I do not know what to do i feel so clueless. I still live at home. I feel like I should be doing something great with my life but I am not. Somehow i still feel caught up on my girlfriend who broke up with me 3 years ago and look at her like she is some perfect being and don\u2019t give any other girl the time of day. I just feel so lost and scared that I wont amount to anything. Advice? Should i seek therapy? Thank you.",

You probably dont need to retake years of classes, just the core science classes to being up your gpa. Since you like being in the physical therapy field, why not aim for a DPT? 3.0 is not a  unreasonable gpa to get accepted into a PT program, given you had division I experience. I know many friends who went into nursing and are now NPs and making a ton of money with lots of job prospects. Do what your heart tells you to do, not what society of your family demands of you. A fancy title will only hold you up to a certain degree, the earlier you realize that living authentically is key to happiness the better.

I dress like a teenager, act like one and even look like one, probably because I\u2019m autistic/ADHD so less mature than neurotypical people. \nI lament every day the wasted time I\u2019ve had, it\u2019s taken me this long to mature to young adulthood level, and I haven\u2019t achieved any of my potential. In fact I messed up my body and my life by using drugs for years.

I fear I have lost that forever and can\u2019t stop thinking about how stupid I was. \nSo now I worry at 40 that I\u2019m too old to achieve my dreams anymore. Though I still intend to try. OP, at 25 you are not too old and I think society would still see you as young throughout your 20s. I also hate how certain expectations are placed on us according to our age. Everyone is different.

Then I moved to a city I love where I\u2019m friends with 23 year olds and 50+ and everywhere in between, and I don\u2019t even think about age. \nI just turned 30 and in the past few years, I visited Europe for the first time, gotten married, started standup comedy and multiple other hobbies, started another business, and countless other things. Some of them I have always wanted to do, and others I never thought I COULD do. You have so much to look forward to, and it\u2019s honestly hard to see that until you do it and look back. \nMy advice: 1) Live in the age you are. In my early 20\u2019s, I had a job where I felt I needed to act 35. It made me feel like I lost some of my 20\u2019s. Be the age you are, and enjoy it so much. I could be wrong, but it seems like people who hold onto 25 as they age do so because they didn\u2019t let themselves be 25 when they WERE 25. Be 25 now. Be 30 when you\u2019re 30. \n2) Don\u2019t fear the future. The future\u2019s gonna come, and it\u2019s gonna be entirely different than what you thought. It\u2019s gonna feel like YOU. Your tastes and interests and hobbies and friends will change and it\u2019ll fit you in the stage you\u2019re in. I\u2019ve never had better friends than I do now. A few years ago I started doing what I want to do instead of what I thought I\u2019m supposed to do, and it was a total game changer. I have friend I adore and we share common interests. Some of my friends have kids (I don\u2019t yet) and some don\u2019t. We still all relate and hang out and it\u2019s beautiful. \n3) Consider moving, or meeting new people. Idk where you live, and maybe I\u2019m just projecting. But EVERYONE where I grew up thought this way and it influenced me more than I realized. It wasn\u2019t until I moved to a city I love that I was able to break free and live MY life, free from those pressures/influences. \n4) Trust yourself. Make good decisions for your future, but know that worrying doesn\u2019t do anybody any good. Plan for the future (financially, career wise, AND friend wise), but live in the now. \n5) Who gives af what people think! You probably won\u2019t be into 20 year olds when you\u2019re 30, I can basically guarantee that lol. They look like children to me now. You\u2019ll grow up and so will your interests. Don\u2019t overthink it. \nHopefully that all makes sense and helps. You got this!!",

I stopped going out drinking/partying when I was about 22 and in retrospect I'm so glad I did that. I still look a decade younger without plastic surgery, which is pretty awesome.\nIf you think \"life is going by too fast\" at 25, just wait until you get to 30. I was 30 yesterday, but my documents say I'm actually 37. I don't believe that, I don't feel that, I don't see that in the mirror. Time really is weird and as we age, it seems to get shorter and shorter.",

I went through a similar thing in my 20s because I felt like life (careers opportunities, romantic opportunities, etc) would take a turn for the worse after my 20s.  Funny thing is though, after turning 30...I realized that age was really a mindset.  \nThe world makes us feel we aren't worth anything past our 20s.  Like Beauty Pageants set age limits on it (as if older women can't be beautiful) and when a boy band comes back in their 30s they use terms like \"washed up\" or has been.  But I am starting to see a change in society where people are becoming more aware that age doesn't mean the end of life and actually it's really the beginning.  I feel better in my 30s than I ever did in my 20s.\nI still love a lot of the things I've loved ever since I was a teenager.  I still love collecting dolls, watching anime, video games, and drawing.  My great aunt loves Spongebob and watches it every morning even when her grandkids aren't with her. ha ha.  Age shouldn't be the end of who we are.  If anything it enhances and completes us.  I'm able to like the things I like and now I can afford it.  \nWhen I was in my 20s and everyone around me was getting married, having kids, I felt so left behind.  Now that I'm in my 30s, I'm actually glad I didn't rush into those things.  What may have been good for others was not necessarily good for me. I realized this when I reached my 30s. \nNo matter how old you are, live your life for you and enjoy it how you want to enjoy it.",

If it makes you feel about better I feel like I wasted my ENTIRE 20s. But I'm not always sure it can be helped. The thing you're lacking most in your 20s is experience, and looking back with hindsight is always \"sure\" but you have to be kind to yourself. Things will unfold and perhaps you'll find some purpose in life (bc it sounds like you're looking). \nAlso, ppl are getting married and raising kids much later on in life now. Getting married early frequently leads to divorce and missed our experiences (in my opinion) and there's nothing wrong with doing that stuff at whatever age, or never!\nI just turned 40 so that's a whole other hill to climb. 30s was an amazing era for me, just needed to meet the right people. Don't stress or be too hard on yourself. Try to get out and have some experiences. And you're right our society is totally ageist. I find it to be striking when I watch TV from other countries and realize how much more older ppl are represented on TV. I'm terrified for 50, personally.",

I look at them and think what a bunch of babies. Besides the point, if the connection is genuinely there who cares? Again, as long as they're of legal age. Also, plenty of people in their 20s, 30s, and beyond don't have children. Some of us choose not to, don't care who looks down on me for it. I also might be looked down upon by someone for liking cartoons. Because I like to draw and because animation is fun. Again, they can suck on a pencil. Getting older comes with realizing that the opinions someone has of you in their mind hold no weight. They aren't even real most of the time, probably, they're just the projection of your fear of how others might perceive you.",

Comparing yourself to others and worrying about societal standards will just age you more. Part of feeling young is a mindset and the other part is taking care of your body. So do that and don\u2019t stress. Live for yourself.",

 "text": "Hi, soon to be 27 here. Diagnosed depressed and anxiety/PTSD if that matters, just cause you know, the struggle. Just wanna let you know, I\u2019m not a parent, def understand your concern with aging because I felt the same way, but honestly, it doesn\u2019t feel that different. Like yeah, I can\u2019t keep up with all the new trends and humor 100% but it just doesn\u2019t really matter, you know? And fuck people who make fun of aging, you\u2019re either lucky enough to get there or you\u2019re dead. Either way, the age is coming and that\u2019s okay. I made those same jokes and I can understand the perspective but in reality, those people who are 19/20/21 are just as well on their way to our age too. \nIt\u2019s true, life moves too fast. I also \u201cwasted\u201d my early 20s, but in actuality, no one wasted anything. If you enjoyed any of it, then it was worth it, even if it was only a little bit.\nAlso, idk if this is relevant, but I\u2019m pushing 30 and I still buy stuffed animals, I still make bad choices, I still am learning how to do this. You don\u2019t just turn 18 and have all the answer. My frontal lobe just got done developing and we gotta maneuver new shit all the time. Give yourself the space to be yourself and enjoy the rest of your 20s guilt free if you can. Everything is okay. You doing your life however you need or want is perfectly normal and you\u2019re gonna do great at whatever you want. You got this.",

I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to do that right thing but I continue to fall short. Nothing I do is enough for me, everyone around says I\u2019m doing good but I still feel empty. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing anyone, everyday is the same I wake go to work come home and go to sleep and repeat. I can\u2019t save money so that way I can get the fuck out of time house I can\u2019t focus my time to things that I need to get done, instead I just moop around hoping that someone will do it for me although I know it\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019ve set this false reality in my head and I know it\u2019s fake I just continue to try to live it. Maybe because it\u2019s the only thing that I\u2019ve ever felt SAFE doing. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m scared and being a pussy. But what and I scared of? I got this giant front on that I\u2019m a big strong man but I\u2019m not if someone just let me talk with out interrupting me maybe I could let it all out. But then they would see that I\u2019m a weak man. All my relationships fail all my goals and dreams don\u2019t even seem reachable anymore, I can\u2019t see them but every time I think I\u2019m getting close they get further away. I don\u2019t feel good about anything. I don\u2019t even remember them last time I enjoyed myself sober. Now that I\u2019m trying to get sober to become closer to god it\u2019s like I can\u2019t feel happiness. Maybe it\u2019s the \u201cwithdrawal\u201d but I don\u2019t know.",
