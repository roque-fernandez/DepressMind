 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

Too ashamed to look at any of my professors, I feel like I'm just too much of a pain to deal with. Really pushed and planned for going back tomorrow no matter what I feel, but a professor emailed me and I think they think I cheated on my midterm. I didn't, but if it's taken as a cheated paper I might get expelled, and I think that might just be the thing that does it for me. I hate that every thought is \"suicide\", I hate that I feel like I'm faking my depression, and I feel terrible just for posting all of this, but there's no point not to, I guess. I don't know what I'm reaching for here.",

I didn't reply.\nNow she's married and im depressed, alone, and lost. \nI should have told her that we should have made it work even despite the distance, spwcially after I found out that she now married someone that she had also met long distance. So clearly she would have been okay making long-distance work.\nI missed out on the one girl who really loved me, and I really loved.

Having nothing to look forward to nothing to hope for is a bad place to be in but I also truly believe that in a way that mindset saved my life.\nI know it's alot  sometimes and i still think about sharing a shower with a toaster from time to time but I am no longer in a position I would do it. Now I am just focused on trying to get out of that survival mode mindset because i don't need it anymore and as anything that doesn't serve a purpose for me I try to remove it.\nTrying to make friends, meet a partner and build a life that I can be proud of is hard work but for me it's just necessity now!",
