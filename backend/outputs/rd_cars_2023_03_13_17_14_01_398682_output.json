 "text": "Jaguar's problem is that SUVs/CUVs are popular and Land Rover exists in the same company. Look at how long wait lists are for the Defender, new Range Rover or Range Rover Sport, the company clearly has no issues investing in and producing vehicles people want to buy.\nI do think Jaguar had the right idea with the F-Pace, make a handsome sporty alternative CUV to what Land Rover offers that is also cheaper for people who aren't in Land Rover's price bracket. I see lots of earlier F-Paces around all the time in my area. Unfortunately, they let the  F-Pace whither on the vine with very little updates for 5 years before giving it a great refresh for the 2022 model year, but with supply chain issues, it seems they are prioritizing Land Rovers for production.\nIn term's of Jaguar's other products I think the E-Pace is uncompetitive, doesn't look as sleek as the German competitors, and I cant remember the last time it got an update? They cancelled development of the J-Pace which could have competed with the X7, Q7/Q8 and GLS but would also compete with Land Rover products. On the car front, the XE and XF seem to basically be on life support and only have 4 cylinder options which  is sad for the luxury segment. The F-Type is still cool though but they are competing in a low volume luxury sports car market against Porsche, BMW and others which is a tough market to be in.",

 "text": "So I think the core issue you have to solve is Jaguar having to find a slot in the luxury game that doesnt cause them to significantly step on Land Rover's toes. Realistically there are two options:\n\nJaguar slots under Land Rover like they have always done. It does mean that Land Rover probably has to move upmarket a bit to create some more breathing room and drop or rework their cheaper models like the Discovery, Discovery Sport and maybe the Range Rover Evoque? This market is a bit problematic in that you are fighting the big German 3 here and margins are lower so you need more volume to justify it. Not to mention the Germans have loads of money and continued investment that Jaguar also needs to do to keep up. Alfa Romeo has a similar problem in this segment as well in terms of money, competition and needing continued investment. For Jaguar to stand out, they will need to differentiate and in the past it's been sleek sexy lines like when the F-Pace first came out or the F-Type. I think they have fixed their interior issues in the new F-Pace so keeping that and updating the E-Pace would be a huge step.\nLike the most recent CEO suggested, Jaguar has to move upmarket beyond Land Rover and start making cars at similar prices to Rolls Royce, Mercedes S-Classes, the Cadillac Celestiq. This I think is a really tall task because the Jaguar brand for the last decade has been associated with cars between the 40k-90k range and you have to build the brand prestige up to convince people to pay more. I think its doable, but you have to expect it to take a decade of you building good cars at the high price point bracket and losing money along the way. Building prestige takes time and money, and there are very little shortcuts.\n\nThat being said, electric is a huge change in terms of performance, powertrains, reliability, etc and its a bit of a clean sheet that Jaguar could use to start again fixing some stuff. But its also a clean sheet for everyone else so there is opportunity but vulnerability too.\nAlso regardless of the path, I think Jaguar should continue to rely on their exterior styling folks to make their cars standout. Every car they have released recently has been good looking (outside of the I-Pace and F-Type refresh IMO). People do like good looking cars after all and in the luxury market, I think cars also act as a fashion accessory for many.",

I think we can all agree the F-type is not as good as a Boxster, but it's a different proposition. It's more of a brutish muscle car whereas the Boxster is more precise. I think of them like an axe vs a scalpel. Sometimes you need the accuracy of a scalpel, and sometimes you just want the satisfaction of swinging an axe. \nFor me it's less a question of whether the F-type is better than everything else and more whether it offers an experience that no one else does. It's different from a Boxster and better than a Mustang or Camaro (IMO at least). The Z4 and TTRS give it some trouble, but if you want the big V8 rumble and the pops and bangs then I think the F-type has carved out a unique place for itself. I see more of them in the Northeast USA than I do any of the Boxster, Z4, or TTRS.",

Add in inferior after-sales, reliability issues/reputation, and it just meant that people weren't willing to switch from their German/Japanese luxury cars.\nLong product cycles haven't helped them either. Their cars are often out-of-date compared to rivals that are getting constant updates or full-on replacements.\nI think to be successful they needed to be first-movers in new product categories, especially considering the disruption the industry is facing on a whole. Sadly, they seemed to have fudged that up too. The I-Pace was a solid electric car at launch, well-reviewed, well-liked, ahead of its competitors, but lack of updates means it's fallen behind in key areas. Also Jaguar failed to capitalize on the momentum of that car, and soldered on with an aging, conventional range otherwise.",

 "text": "Long product cycles are a key thing I think in the luxury market. When you are competing with the Germans who are constantly updating their most important models, if you don't update for a while, your product slowly becomes uncompetitive. When they do make an update, JLR is pretty good at making a product that people desire but then they let it slowly die on the vine. It seems to be a consistent issue in the luxury game imho with many brands. Look at Infiniti, look at a bunch of Lexus models (though Lexus gets a pass because they have great reliability which on its own is enough to sway many people). The only new company that seems to get it is Genesis, they are consistently updating their cars even if they don't sell well in the US. Not how long they will keep doing this though before they get tired and give up as well.",

Then briefly while I was in high school they were cool hip hop cars with the Escalade and the CTS. But that died off I guess during the recession since, unsurprisingly, people aren\u2019t shopping for massive, expensive SUVs with poor fuel economy when money is tight. \nYoung people today don\u2019t even seem all that interested in cars at all. And if they are many wanted a Tesla since they were like spaceships. Cadillac might\u2019ve had a chance if they put out something to compete with the Model S back around 2012 but all GM had was the small eco-looking Bolt so yet another squandered opportunity. \nAnd why didn\u2019t they put the Voltec power train in their SUVs?  It\u2019d be easier to sell expensive \u201cluxury\u201d SUVs if they got decent fuel economy and had some EV range. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Escalades so far have healthy and growing sales figures, but who knows if it will remain true going forward.\nFuel economy: anyone who is buying a new escalade can just accept the fuel usage. It's an expensive car. Your car payments are gonna be way bigger than your fuel bills. Escalades burn more fuel than most cars, but it is also way more expensive than most cars.",

 "text": "too little, too late\n\nI think this especially true with the SUVs. The F-Pace didn't go into production until MY16. Even now, when I think of SUVs, Jaguar is just not in my mind at all. When I read this title, my brain's first reaction is \"who goes to Jaguar for an SUV?\" I really just picture them as the sporty British racing cars and I don't think they've done much to cultivate outside of that image until very recently even though it's been the market direction for ages now.\nDefinitely agreed on the progress of tech, too. It's hard for a Jag to go against something like Mercedes or BMW on tech and tech refreshes, and I feel like the market for \"sexy\" cars is just getting smaller. It already feels crowded with others like Porsche around, and they had basically the first mainstream \"luxury-sports\" SUV.\nMy brain mostly just thinks of Jags more as a bit rougher and less unrefined, since they always felt more sporty than luxury, and I'm not sure how much of that space exists in the market anymore, especially with other brands like BMW having a more combined sports, tech and luxury feel. Jag just feels more like they held onto the emotional aspect of the cars, which is certainly something I can appreciate, but I also think the market for weekend emotional cars is getting smaller, especially in the \"somewhat vaguely affordable\" section of the market. It seems like more and more people want a single vehicle that does everything, and I just don't really see Jag as that in my mind.\nThey're pivoting out of that now in the last 5-10 years, it seems, but I don't know how many people have been paying close attention to them anymore.",
