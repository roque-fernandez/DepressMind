I'm working on it. \nWhat sparked this post, is that I'm currently in the middle of preparations for funeral of one of my closest family members, who gave me home when I needed it as a child long time ago. So it's even harder than other funerals and I really need a bit \"escape\" from all of this.\nEDIT 2: I'm truly floored with the amount of amazing suggestions and thoughtful messages. I'm reading through all of it and trying to respond to most of the comments. Hopefully this post will not only help me but also many others who are in the similar situation.\nAnd for all of you that are currently in similar situation: Please don't loose hope.
