 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to go, but therapy has never really helped me with this problem and I can't bring it up to my mom or grandparents because I'm tired of the endless cycle of me justifiably bringing up an issue and them starting a fight. There's a thousand and one reasons I have depression relating to every poor way my parents \"parented\" me growing up from the neglect of my dad and blatant abuse of my mom and grandfather. But the thing that drove me up a fucking wall today was, my grandmom retired recently and she can't find anything to keep her busy so she just keeps fixing random crap around our house that doesn't need fixing, and bugging the rest of us. I suggested she journal, read, or write a story, she thought it was a good idea, so I went down into our basement guest room where I have a lot of my things stored from college still, to find her a book. And it was re-arranged when my grandparents retired so my grandfather could work on his coin collection. I walk into the room and see my stuff re-arranged. Oh well, as long as it's there neat I'm cool with it. Then I turn around and see the 5 journals I kept through the 3 years of college I had, lined up next to a bunch of old school work and art work my uncle made when he was a kid that my grandmom and mom have been reading and laughing over. So I have this irking and explosive rage building up in me right now that's there because I feel it's pretty obvious that my mom and grandmom have been reading my private shit. It's making me want to explode and yell at them all right now, but I know they'll just try and gas light me and spin on me that I'm the bad guy. I know the easy answer is \"its their house, they can do what they want, move out\", and I've heard it before. But I am trying to move out, it's difficult, and even if I am living here, I bought those journals, and I wrote them when I was living at school, that doesn't give them the right to invade my privacy. And if I haven't mentioned this already the reason I'm so paranoid is because my mom has read my journal without my consent before, during covid, when I was at a really low place with depression working my ass off to pass online physics and chemistry classes that are impossible enough in person and I was going crazy studying extra hours online to pass. And she took everything I wrote out of context, and even though she was barely even mentioned in my journal entries, she decided to take the whole thing personally and cause more problems for me by calling me selfish and starting more fights. I think she's bipolar or borderline personality, because I flipped out at her to never do that again or I'd leave the house and stop talking to her, and she did it again after a few weeks, so I started leaving threats in my journal to hurt her, knowing she'd disobey the one thing I ask of her, hoping she'd stop, but she just started more shit, and then suddenly started leaving weird fake sentimental notes in my journals and always found them no matter where I hid them, as if that would somehow absolve her of the fact she's invading my privacy, insincere apology written in a book your forbidden to write in or not, that's still going against the one thing I ask her not to do, so I followed through and I left mid-way through covid and lived with my dad until move in day the following semester at college, barely speaking to my mom. Then I move back in with her after college and a year goes by, nothing bad except a few arguments, and now we're here, where I see all of my journals removed from where I put them, all neatly stacked in ORDER BY YEAR, making me believe she STILL went against my wishes and read my shit. \nWhat can I do about this until I can move out? I don't want to bring this up to her or my grandparents because I don't want to deal with my mom starting shit and making me feel bad for being born at the moment. And I'm not on good terms with my dad either (long story short he ran off and started a new family with an abusive woman who treated me and my sister like garbage) so I can't just simply up and move there. This is just the tip of the ice berg on how my family has treated me, there is much worse out there that they've done in my life but this is the most recent thing. And I feel really bad saying this but, I've never been a violent person, I've never wanted to hurt anyone nor have I ever attempted to without reasonable cause (self-defense), but I catch myself wishing my family would just all up and die some days, like since I can't get out yet it feels like the only relief I'll get is them all just permanently shutting up. When I finally get to move out I'm just going to cut her off as well as my grandparents and maybe my dad (I say maybe because I still have young half siblings living with him that I would like to be able to know), but for now the only feelings I have for them is dread and the horrifying desire for them to just stop existing. I don't know how to handle this anger, I just know that it's going to eat away at me until something bad happens, like an early life heart attack or something, my blood pressure is already high for my age and it's only gotten higher because of the stress and anger my family causes, I don't know what to do.",

 "text": "So I'm graduating university soon, honours and everything. It's a huge achievement and everyone is congratulating me and telling me I ought to be so proud of myself.  Since I have horrible mental health, it was a real struggle to get through - there were so many sleepless nights, breakdowns and I pushed myself to my absolute limit on many occasions. So reaching the end should be a pretty big victory.\nWhen I started uni, I was basically a recluse who didn't know how to talk to people and had zero social life. However, through a combination of therapy, medication and just how easy uni makes it to socialise, I managed to really come out of my shell. I became the president of a campus social club. Went on a lot of dates. Made some friends. Worked on some really interesting projects. Hell, I even started dressing well. I've been told I'm practically unrecognizable compared to the way I was when I started. It's a real success story. University doesn't necessarily make anything easier, but it makes the opportunities to improve more accessible - want to make friends? Here's a specific event you can go to this week filled with people that have similar interests. It sets you up for success, if you can push yourself to go for it.\nSo after saying all that, you may be wondering what I'm doing here. The problem is, I feel like the only part of my life that's ever mattered is over. These past years have been so eventful and vibrant, and I'm only just realising that now that it's ending. Sort of like how you don't realise when the good old days are until they're over.  What am I even supposed to do with myself now? Nothing will ever be as exciting, and all the social opportunities I enjoyed are going to be much fewer and far between. It might seem silly to be sad about literally achieving my goals, but the university lifestyle is just so dynamic and interesting and I don't want it to end.\nA few people know that I've been struggling with this, but I don't think anybody realises the full extent.  I feel like I've been wearing a mask. A few months from now when I step up onto that stage and accept my degree, it feels like my life will be over.  Like if I ended things right there, that would be fine and I would have ended up a high note. For a while I didn't even want to end things anymore, but now I'm starting to feel that way again.\nI feel worse than I have in ages and it's because I turned myself around and am close to achieving something I've been working towards for a long time. Sounds silly when I say it out loud. But it's how I'm feeling right now.",

I already had to go to the hospital twice for a chest drain which was not a very pleasant experience. I however don't get why because everything went well and everyone was so nice, but I am still terrified. I know I have had it happen more than twice because I have felt the same symptoms multiple times on other occasions, but I am to scared to do anything. But because it happened twice already the chance of it happening again is big and everytime it happens there advice for an operation is stronger, which greatly decreases the chance. This time  I said I said I will wait till next time and get the operation then. I am still scared though, but I also want it to be over so badly. One of the reasons I said no this time is because for a while now I haven't felt great, which stupid enough I am also too scared to say to anyone. But at the moment I am also so scared I will get it again now, which wants to make me get the surgery just to get over with it.",

But I empathize. \nI have struggled with depression for so long. I thought alcohol and drugs were causing it, but I\u2019ve been sober 5+ years and I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s deeper than that. It\u2019s like a dark pit of self hatred built into my brain. \nI\u2019ve taken suicide off the table after a friend did it and I saw how devastated everyone was. I have a daughter and can\u2019t do that to her. \nSo I\u2019m gonna ride this thing out until I die.\nI wish I could tell one soul in the whole world that I\u2019m depressed without them trying to fix me. I honestly think that is what contributes to the loneliness.\nEdit: without them trying to fix or or convert me to their religion. I hate that one too.",

So many people cannot understand that without meaningful relief/fulfillment we lose motivation to do anything positive anymore.  The emotional state stays the same at the end of the day regardless of how hard I try to be healthy.  There are a few things I will try doing before giving up but if they fail to give relief I am actually scared of what will come after that.  Everything is crumbling and rotting away.  I don't think my will to live will sustain for much longer.",

I want to know that you're either going to contact me and settle it or you're never going to contact me again.  I still haven't erased your numbers out of my phone.  I don't know why you have/had so many numbers.  It made me start to think you were leading a double life or something.  I remember you let me look at your phone and then after you took it back you vigorously rubbed off my fingerprints.  I don't know what that was about.  It made me think again that you were afraid I was going to see something I shouldn't see.  I'm still terrified I'm going to hit them one of these days.  I want to know either way so I can stop.  I'll have to stop it myself because I do make myself look like a psychopath.  Maybe that's a good thing,  I don't know.\nPeople are right, I'm too emotional.  There is no winning with this.  I hate even using the term \"winning\" because that would imply there's a winner and a loser, but everybody loses so I don't know what to call it.  I've tried to think about a way in which it could work and it can't.  I don't think that makes me a bad person.  I think I'm fairly sensible even if I'm emotional.",
