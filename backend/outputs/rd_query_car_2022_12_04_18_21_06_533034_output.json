    "text": "AITA for threatening to tell my husband's sister and her husband about the tracking device he put in her car? Very recently, I found out that my husband had installed a tracking device in his sister's car (he's a mechanic) while he was fixing it for her. I confronted him and he refused to tell me what was going on or expand on the situation. His sister and I are close. I threatened him to tell her and her husband but he lashed out saying that this has nothing to do with me and that I was out of line to get myself involved. He told me \"it's complicated\" that he can't say anything to me now and that I should keep my nose out of it. We had an argument and he started avoiding me saying there's gonna be an issue if I go through with my threat.\nAITA for threatning to tell her? Should I back off?\nMore context: I was asked to put more context but I'm not sure what is and isn't relevent. But I found out about the tracking device when I heard him talking on the phone, he said his mom was on the phone and she knew about it but I doubt it because she's close to my SIL and also, when he was talking on the phone it didn't sound like he was talking to his mom. His tone was more formal than usual.",
