 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "Long story short. I'm in a therapy-like program where someone comes to my house but haven't had a real meeting yet. The last 1 1/2 weeks I was in full avoidance and retreat mode. My phone was on the other side of my apartment. It was 1 1/2 weeks and already they're threatening to not treat me. We haven't had an appointment. All I did was nothing to get a next appointment. I could understand if we had 2 Appointments and I wasn't there. The person I'm supposed to do it with seems angry and I can't really handle that. Very bad way to start treatment.\nThe Calendar of the person seems full, so I don't think they lost out on anything. I'm terrified now. I will try to apologise, I'm aware this isn't great behaivior, but regardless I'm in full psychotic-Anxienty Mode, waiting for another call. Can't calm down.\nCan't tell what is appropriate and what isn't right now. My mind doing mind things.\nEven if everything fails, there're more offers like this in my city. But I can't emotionally process that atm",

Great kids..  \nBut I still feel like a fraud and a failure.\nAnd =I know where it stems from. I had horrible siblings and the only parental figure I had I love died when I was young.  My grandparents did their best to support me but they were emotionally disconnected.  Where crying was not done publicly.  \nThere is a whole sub chapter to that... and there are multiple facets to that that point to my issues.   \nBy why does every drug they want to put you on make you just feel numb to everything?\nI don't what all my emotions subdued,  I just want to have them feel like they are overcome able.   Instead of a vast void, just a challenge to step forward...  \nlogically I have NO reason to feel as bad about myself as I do.   And fuck that just makes it worse.  SO many people have is so much worse... I just want real help that works that doesn't turn you into an emotional zombie.....",
