Live at home with my mum and brother. My mum has cancer and my two brothers I get on with but I know they wouldn't take me seriously if I said I was depressed. With my mum being ill I'm worried about the future as if she died I wouldn't be able to afford to pay my siblings to keep the house. In my family over the years every one in my family has tried to coming suicide, i am the only one who hasn't done anything that extreme.",

 "text": "We have to stay alive to find out, and that means fighting tooth and nail just to create meaning.\nMost of modern society is designed to take meaning and joy away from us. Addictive distractions designed only to monetize our time; jobs that rob us of a sense of fulfillment by forcing us to be cogs; the ever present threat of the necessity of money; vapid culture made to appeal to the lowest common denominator; old systems clinging to power at the dispense of others; people who confuse belligerence and abuse for respect, etc.\nYou can\u2019t actually know if you were \u201cnever\u201d happy until your life is over, though. You can end life and have the satisfaction of that self-fulfilled prophecy, but why actively seek the least life has to offer? Resist your exploiters, resist unfair truths, resist the draw of familiar sadness. Be greedy, be ambivalent, be distracted as long as you want. \nWe distract because we are in pain, but the very fact that we mourn this wasted time means we want more, deep down. Soothe the pain, wrestle the sources of pain into submission, then do the single most difficult task of asking yourself what you want.\nWe have to beat back the lingering emptiness with our own bloody fists- but it\u2019s a war of attrition, and the time frame is our whole lives.",

I have feelings of hopelessness, embarrassment, no confidence, loneliness, anxiety, and depression. I'm on a contract job for 3 months making $35 an hour with just my car to pay which is $452 a month however I have no savings due to the reasons of changing jobs/careers over the years and dealing with mental health issues such as anxiety/ocd/depression/adhd and past trauma from intimate relationships, past jobs such as law enforcement, childhood trauma as well. I feel like a complete failure, not only to myself but to my family and friends and I did not envision my life to be like this at 30, I have goals to have my own house and being happily married with children. I feel completely lost in life and I'm only getting older, if anyone out there has experiences or advice to give please leave a comment. Thank you.",

Normally, I\u2019m a hard worker, but the grief took all of the wind out of my sails; haven\u2019t worked since December, been living with my parents for the last two years. No money, no girlfriend (though I\u2019m getting laid here and there so there\u2019s that), and no jobs in the works. \nBut, I\u2019ve kept myself occupied with a personal trainer program that I just finished and am studying for the exam that I\u2019m hoping to take this month. I\u2019ve been hitting the gym consistently for the last few months and have noticed I\u2019m getting stronger. I try to hang out with my friends when I\u2019m feeling it and go to baseball games here and there, too. There\u2019s things you can do to occupy yourself and have a good time, just don\u2019t think you need to have everything figured out and/or have a family and house and career that you love and everything; just try to focus on something to take up your time, get a hobby, maybe consider going back to school, as long as it prevents you from focusing on feeling sorry for yourself. Honestly, that\u2019s been the biggest thing in my life recently. \nHope this helps, reach out if I can help any further.",

 "text": "30 hit me hard- I thought I'd be further along in life too. But 30 is still young and you have a good decade to get married and have kids. My aunt was having kids past 40 still. I had my second child at 32 with no problem, and I have friends who didn't even marry and start having kids until their 30s. I'm still unmarried.  My cousin is a lawyer and had a one night stand ( i think this was thought out and planned during ovulation- she's not admitting to it) and had a baby at 36. She is raising him on her own. You have a good opportunity right now. Your future is full of possibilities.  You can save money, decide what you want to do, date, not date, decide where you want to live...you can make goals and work on them without a partner influencing you or children. \nI'm 40 and just recently have my own home- i lived in projects with my kids for years. I still feel behind and like a loser sometimes but if I stop comparing myself to other people I let myself be happy where I'm at.",
