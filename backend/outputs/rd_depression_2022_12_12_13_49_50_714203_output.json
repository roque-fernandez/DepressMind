    "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

That\u2019s not the problem, because of my depression I\u2019ve never felt I can tell someone my problems because I don\u2019t want to pull them under my dark cloud, which I feel everyone can see. So I just internalized my anger at this dude for 2 days and now it just came out. I came out the shower so angry thinking about how I didn\u2019t say shit to this guy and that it\u2019s my parents fault I can\u2019t stand up for myself, that I was literally muttering curse words under my breath like a homeless psycho. I pass my mom in the hallway and she asks how I am ( it\u2019s just me and my mom in a small house, my dad cheated on her so she got the house in the divorce), I say \u201cgreat\u201d in a mean tone. I get in my room and start kicking my bed and just basically yeah obscenities and nasty mean things. My mom and I have been having problems, so she thinks im saying this about her, and they partly were geared towards because I know I can be a asshole to her and she kinda just has to deal with it. She come screaming in my room, like loud and angry, and I just stand there thinking these horrible thoughts about her, she leave then I kick the door hard right after she shuts it, come in screaming louder and angrier saying I have to be out in 30 days. And now I\u2019m here typing about it. If I wasn\u2019t such a depressed loser and said something to this Italian boy I don\u2019t think I would be taking it out on my mom. But I hate that I\u2019ve become this person, I hate myself so much for hurting my mom and my dad and letting other people hurt me. I want to be different, I don\u2019t want to die but I see no purpose to trying to be better, I truly believe I\u2019ll just be this depressed loser who let\u2019s people walk over him and then takes his anger out on the wrong people. What type of life is that? I feel like death is my only option. Anyways it\u2019s nice to put this somewhere, I definitely can\u2019t tell my friends about this.",
