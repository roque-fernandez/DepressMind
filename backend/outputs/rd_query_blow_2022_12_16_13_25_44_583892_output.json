The unselfish, defensive-minded tandem of Alex Caruso and Ball helped offset the offense first/defense optional Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107\nChicago gave up a lot to get Vu\u010devi\u0107 (32) and needs to win the lottery (top four) to avoid giving its selection to the Magic. The decision to blow it up must come quickly while the Bulls (10-14) are in range of a high pick. Five teams sit on just seven wins\u2014a good week or two could push Chicago entirely out of range. The Bulls also owe the Spurs a heavily protected first to the Spurs for DeRozan.\nAccording to NBA sources, the Lakers are interested in both Vu\u010devi\u0107 and DeRozan. If L.A. is willing to give up two first-round picks (2027 and 2029) along with Russell Westbrook as a buy-out candidate, the Bulls may end up in a better lottery position to retain their pick in June. This is the draft to do it.\nChicago could also look to move LaVine (after Jan. 15), who re-signed on a five-year, $215.2 million contract this summer. His name hasn't buzzed yet on the rumor mill, but Chicago could find willing suitors if it made the two-time All-Star available.\nThe alternative is losing its first to Orlando\u2014barring a low-percentage lottery miracle\u2014and re-signing Vu\u010devi\u0107 in July. The team would have its mid-level exception (likely in the $11 million range) and smaller trades to try to perfect what many around the league believe to be a low-ceiling roster.\nOr Chicago could divest itself from everything that isn't nailed down (outside of its young, developing prospects) and start over, which is precisely what many others believe it should do.\n\nThoughts? The Bulls have a lot of interesting pieces that could get back a lot of picks if they wanted to go that route",

    "text": "The amount of men implying that their wives blow all of their hard-earned money on \"bullshit\" when a woman's name is clearly in the payment details, is too damn high I work as a pickup clerk for online grocery orders. Often times I'll run out to their vehicle, get their name/order number, and be met with a rolling of eyes and \"Who knows what bullshit she ordered THIS time, good luck fitting all of it!\" More often than not, they're reasonable purchases, taking advantage of weekend deals and whatnot. Fits in the tiny backseat of their pickup truck ironically wasted on hauling things.\nAnd the woman's name is clearly listed in the payment details. Either she footed the bill for their \"unnecessary bullshit\" food habits, or they have some arrangement for him to transfer money to her for household necessities. I don't know. Either way, I'm just some minimum wage employee who notices patterns, and this is one I've picked up on.\nEdit: Just woke up and wow, this post got huge overnight. I just wanna clarify that yes, I obviously don't know their financial arrangements, and her name on the card doesn't necessarily mean she paid. I probably could've expressed that more coherently, didn't expect thousands of people to read this, lol. But it just seems shitty either way to throw your SO under the bus to a stranger as frivolous for buying groceries and necessities.\nEspecially when said SO may very well be the one paying for the food that they'll both eat. I get like 4-5 of these dudes daily, I doubt that every single one has a joint account, so more than a few of them are just perpetuating some lame stereotype (that their wives just loooove shopping and frivolously spend the man's money) while they're not even the ones paying for their own damn food.",

First off, I know that I am very privileged and not saying this to shame those that can't afford one, but referring to those that can afford one, but don't see the need. My roommate recently came into my room and asked me to look up the nearest phone repair store after she shattered her screen, and that's when I realized she had no other way of accessing the internet. No desktop or laptop, just her phone. As someone who spends most of their free time on the computer either programming, doing homework, working, or just watching YouTube and playing games, it blows my mind that something integral to my daily life (for better or worse), some people just don't see the need for. It's not like im some troglodyte that never leaves the house or something, just instead of scrolling through TikTok or watching TV like my roomates do, I usually go to YouTube or game with friends. It's just crazy how much something as basic as someone's day-to-day life can differ from your own and you don't really discover that until you live with other people.\nEdit: More talking about younger people that are glued to their phones/the internet in general. I fully understand why someone's mom wouldn't need a computer, because they didn't have one most of their life anyway.",

    "text": "TIFU by blowing all my savings going to Italy [Please read the edits before commenting] I\u2019ve always dreamed of going to Italy, I\u2019m an artist, I (21f) love galleries and art and it\u2019s seemed like a dream for as long as I can remember. I\u2019m from the UK so totally aware of the Paris syndrome etc and wasn\u2019t expecting to be blown away by anything other than the art but I hate it here. \nI\u2019ve been in Verona for two days and then Venice for two and supposed to be here till the end of the week. I\u2019ve been to a few galleries which have been okay but all the time in between that I\u2019ve been crying or trying not to cry. I understand my Italian is limited but the hostility I receive as soon as I start talking - even when I speak in Italian they will talk back to me in English. I\u2019ve barely eaten and my anxiety is through the roof. \nI\u2019ve been staying at hostels because I was hoping to make friends but all the people there are Italians there for work in their 40s/50s and make it clear as they have all told me that I need to be quiet as I\u2019m a tourist and they are working when all I\u2019ve done is quietly sit on my bed. I have to go to the lobby to talk to my mum who I\u2019ve been calling at least twice a day, when usually I call her once a week if that and just cry down the phone. \nI\u2019ve waited all my life for this, spent all of savings and it\u2019s not been worth it even for the art. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so sad and alone.\nTL;DR I\u2019m in Italy, I hate it and now I\u2019m broke. (I spent a lot of savings to go traveling for the first time, I\u2019m stressed and upset and struggling to settle due to my anxiety)\nedit: age\nedit1: Thank you to everyone who\u2019s commented even though some were brutal asf. It\u2019s my first time traveling and my first time traveling alone. I think I thought I would be put in a situation where I had no other choice but to come out my shell and instead its made me regress, terrified to do anything.\nI totally understand that the culture is different and didn\u2019t even think about the fact that in Britain workers are literally forced in their contracts to be happy and friendly lol (Yes I work retail.) \nI have always wanted to travel and enjoy my time alone but I\u2019m feeling very deflated and like a failure. The lack of sleep and food also is probably making things worse. \nI grew a pair though and I\u2019m currently drinking a coffee and having a nice sandwich by the canal rn. Probably going to try pick up a sketchbook so I can explore and draw without feeling as awkward and try to take in my surroundings more.\nedit2: I\u2019m not good at explaining myself, Italians speaking English to me isn\u2019t hostile it\u2019s obviously really helpful it\u2019s the change in attitude they immediately have. Not everyone obviously but most will be laughing and talking in Italian to others when I enter and I say ciao and they greet me nicely back but then when I usually say hello in English to let them know I\u2019ll probably need to order in English they immediately change tune. It\u2019s hard to explain but they go cold, again maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing or I get the \u2018\u201cffs another tourist\u201d feeling\u2019 and they\u2019re just doing their job but it was off putting the amount of times it has happened and made me feel unwelcome.\nProbably a culture shock from expecting a social aspect from cafes the way they are in the uk which had left me feeling more lonely and anxious but looking at it now and talking with people on here I think I\u2019ll just need to get better at getting over it I guess. I also totally get that speaking another language can be hard/take concentration and I\u2019ve probably mistaken that for hostility. \nedit:3 I\u2019ve pre booked my hostel and a gallery for every day so I can\u2019t really jump on a train and go as they are non refundable and I\u2019m excited for the galleries - can\u2019t afford to waste the money so gonna stick it out, the hostel is only a bed to sleep in at the end of the day.\nI genuinely did think I had researched everything enough and the hostel marketed itself as for tourists with a common room and thousands of reviews from people saying it was great, might just be the time of year I\u2019ve decided to go that the clientele is different.\nfinal edit: I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up and thank you for all of the helpful messages. I\u2019m self sufficient and have struggled a lot in life due to shitty circumstances but this trip was something I\u2019ve always dreamed about and I spent months planning with no one in my personal life to offer help. Guess I should have posted on Reddit sooner (mistakes were defo made with hostel - I\u2019ve tried to cancel it and move but they are not letting me and I can\u2019t afford to pay another \u20ac60.) Also reminder we\u2019re in a economic crisis and I have bills to pay, people acting like because this trip isn\u2019t thousands of euros it\u2019s chump change can gtf.\nAs stated I didn\u2019t expect to be living in a Netflix romcom, I\u2019m an introvert and wanted to spend my time alone doing the things I wanted, hence why I came alone. I\u2019d hoped to have a some chats with locals or people in the hostel as my max socialisation but didn\u2019t expect much especially not life long friends. However I\u2019ve struggled more than I thought and had a few interactions that made my anxiety sky rocket and hyper analyse all my other interactions.\nComing from a tourist hot spot back home I understand the pain and anger towards tourists. The woman I\u2019m staying with is probably just apprehensively making sure I am not stumbling in at 2am drunk as many brits like to do and being pretty blunt about it. I will also now say \"Ciao, mi scusi, parla Inglese?\" As its been pointed out me just saying \u201cCiao, hello\u201d may come across as rude which I didn\u2019t realise. This is my first learning experience traveling and I\u2019ve certainly learnt a lot and reached fuck it level.\nThis was intended as a venting post and written in haste from being overwhelmed so I understand the hate and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve not deleted the original bits but I also forgot Reddit is full of dickheads - just tough love I guess :)",

The unselfish, defensive-minded tandem of Alex Caruso and Ball helped offset the offense first/defense optional Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107\nChicago gave up a lot to get Vu\u010devi\u0107 (32) and needs to win the lottery (top four) to avoid giving its selection to the Magic. The decision to blow it up must come quickly while the Bulls (10-14) are in range of a high pick. Five teams sit on just seven wins\u2014a good week or two could push Chicago entirely out of range. The Bulls also owe the Spurs a heavily protected first to the Spurs for DeRozan.\nAccording to NBA sources, the Lakers are interested in both Vu\u010devi\u0107 and DeRozan. If L.A. is willing to give up two first-round picks (2027 and 2029) along with Russell Westbrook as a buy-out candidate, the Bulls may end up in a better lottery position to retain their pick in June. This is the draft to do it.\nChicago could also look to move LaVine (after Jan. 15), who re-signed on a five-year, $215.2 million contract this summer. His name hasn't buzzed yet on the rumor mill, but Chicago could find willing suitors if it made the two-time All-Star available.\nThe alternative is losing its first to Orlando\u2014barring a low-percentage lottery miracle\u2014and re-signing Vu\u010devi\u0107 in July. The team would have its mid-level exception (likely in the $11 million range) and smaller trades to try to perfect what many around the league believe to be a low-ceiling roster.\nOr Chicago could divest itself from everything that isn't nailed down (outside of its young, developing prospects) and start over, which is precisely what many others believe it should do.\n\nThoughts? The Bulls have a lot of interesting pieces that could get back a lot of picks if they wanted to go that route",

    "text": "The amount of men implying that their wives blow all of their hard-earned money on \"bullshit\" when a woman's name is clearly in the payment details, is too damn high I work as a pickup clerk for online grocery orders. Often times I'll run out to their vehicle, get their name/order number, and be met with a rolling of eyes and \"Who knows what bullshit she ordered THIS time, good luck fitting all of it!\" More often than not, they're reasonable purchases, taking advantage of weekend deals and whatnot. Fits in the tiny backseat of their pickup truck ironically wasted on hauling things.\nAnd the woman's name is clearly listed in the payment details. Either she footed the bill for their \"unnecessary bullshit\" food habits, or they have some arrangement for him to transfer money to her for household necessities. I don't know. Either way, I'm just some minimum wage employee who notices patterns, and this is one I've picked up on.\nEdit: Just woke up and wow, this post got huge overnight. I just wanna clarify that yes, I obviously don't know their financial arrangements, and her name on the card doesn't necessarily mean she paid. I probably could've expressed that more coherently, didn't expect thousands of people to read this, lol. But it just seems shitty either way to throw your SO under the bus to a stranger as frivolous for buying groceries and necessities.\nEspecially when said SO may very well be the one paying for the food that they'll both eat. I get like 4-5 of these dudes daily, I doubt that every single one has a joint account, so more than a few of them are just perpetuating some lame stereotype (that their wives just loooove shopping and frivolously spend the man's money) while they're not even the ones paying for their own damn food.",

First off, I know that I am very privileged and not saying this to shame those that can't afford one, but referring to those that can afford one, but don't see the need. My roommate recently came into my room and asked me to look up the nearest phone repair store after she shattered her screen, and that's when I realized she had no other way of accessing the internet. No desktop or laptop, just her phone. As someone who spends most of their free time on the computer either programming, doing homework, working, or just watching YouTube and playing games, it blows my mind that something integral to my daily life (for better or worse), some people just don't see the need for. It's not like im some troglodyte that never leaves the house or something, just instead of scrolling through TikTok or watching TV like my roomates do, I usually go to YouTube or game with friends. It's just crazy how much something as basic as someone's day-to-day life can differ from your own and you don't really discover that until you live with other people.\nEdit: More talking about younger people that are glued to their phones/the internet in general. I fully understand why someone's mom wouldn't need a computer, because they didn't have one most of their life anyway.",

The unselfish, defensive-minded tandem of Alex Caruso and Ball helped offset the offense first/defense optional Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107\nChicago gave up a lot to get Vu\u010devi\u0107 (32) and needs to win the lottery (top four) to avoid giving its selection to the Magic. The decision to blow it up must come quickly while the Bulls (10-14) are in range of a high pick. Five teams sit on just seven wins\u2014a good week or two could push Chicago entirely out of range. The Bulls also owe the Spurs a heavily protected first to the Spurs for DeRozan.\nAccording to NBA sources, the Lakers are interested in both Vu\u010devi\u0107 and DeRozan. If L.A. is willing to give up two first-round picks (2027 and 2029) along with Russell Westbrook as a buy-out candidate, the Bulls may end up in a better lottery position to retain their pick in June. This is the draft to do it.\nChicago could also look to move LaVine (after Jan. 15), who re-signed on a five-year, $215.2 million contract this summer. His name hasn't buzzed yet on the rumor mill, but Chicago could find willing suitors if it made the two-time All-Star available.\nThe alternative is losing its first to Orlando\u2014barring a low-percentage lottery miracle\u2014and re-signing Vu\u010devi\u0107 in July. The team would have its mid-level exception (likely in the $11 million range) and smaller trades to try to perfect what many around the league believe to be a low-ceiling roster.\nOr Chicago could divest itself from everything that isn't nailed down (outside of its young, developing prospects) and start over, which is precisely what many others believe it should do.\n\nThoughts? The Bulls have a lot of interesting pieces that could get back a lot of picks if they wanted to go that route",
