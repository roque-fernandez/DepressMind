I do 2 types of self harm, I do cut when depressed, but then I also scratch my skin very badly, leading to scanning over, when I\u2019m very anxious. I also know someone who self harms by banging there arms together until bruising. Anything done to intentionally physically harm oneself is self harm and anyone who disagrees hasn\u2019t thought about it. Yes, some forms of self harm are more common and known, but that doesn\u2019t make any other way less valid. No one should feel like they have to prove their self harm is valid, and as someone who has felt that way, I hope you won\u2019t.",
