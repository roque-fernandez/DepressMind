 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker.

Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that; \nI fell into the \u201cI want to feel helpful\u201d category despite my best intentions.\nI did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn\u2019t help me and I couldn\u2019t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better. \nAfter that I never replied regarding dm\u2019s and kept it to comment chains only.\nThank you for doing this and thank you for your work, this is a safe place which sometimes might need protecting from itself. After all, in the haze of my own misery and thoughts I never properly read the rules and just.. reached out.",

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I\u2019m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don\u2019t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. \nBut anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk.",

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.\nFor the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.\nNow when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much can't do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.\nWhich is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.\nI don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort.",

It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

So it's appropriate for people to be wary of offers of help that come this way.\nI'm not totally certain if your concern is for people who might want to ask for support in private (which as the post says is always okay although it still carries some risks) or for people who want to offer help in PMs, though...?

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

Now I am just focused on trying to get out of that survival mode mindset because i don't need it anymore and as anything that doesn't serve a purpose for me I try to remove it.\nTrying to make friends, meet a partner and build a life that I can be proud of is hard work but for me it's just necessity now!",

My weight, my looks, the fact I am ignorant to many things. It's something that rarely bothers me. I've came to terms with it after all these years. Plus it's a weird coping mechanism I guess.\nI was talking to a friend of mine in the break room when a co-worker walks in and tells her that she looks beautiful. I go in to make a self deprecating joke like \"hey aren't I beautiful too?\"  The look she gave me and the hesitation to say anything sure left an impression. Funnily enough if she said \"not really\" I could've easily played off that. But to say nothing impacted me more than anything. It's been a few months since anything has put me down easily. I haven't been overthinking and getting into my head as easily. I haven't cut myself since January. But damn. That kinda hit deep. To be fair I was asking for it I suppose. I don't make the best decisions. Fuck.",

There are usually services and/or programs that people facing homelessness and other serious hardships can access. It wont be immediate, but the people working at these resources and programs should be able to help set you up atleast with a framework or plan of what you can do next to get things back on track. If you cant find anything immediately, dont give up. Keep searching. Unless you live in the sticks, most cities have something in place Ask LOTS of questions, programs or services to help with paying for any medications, food stamps, or anything. Take advantage of any program/service you qualify for that can help you. And avoid instant cash loans. They are basically debt traps and will fuck you with extremely high intrest rates.

I feel the build up, my eyes start stinging and then out of nowhere, nothing. I feel nothing. I physically can't cry anymore. Last time I felt like I was having a break down I just started to laugh hysterically and just had this huge grin on my face until I grew numb again. I don't know what's wrong with me. Am I the only one ?\nI lost track of time, a whole year has passed in the blink of an eye and nothing has changed. All the suicide jokes I made to myself have slowly developed into real dark urges. \nI can't kill myself and leave my friends and family to pick up the pieces. So I'm forced to be hopeful though. I was happy 3 years before grief struck, I know I can be happy again. I'm a suicidal optimist, which is extremely goofy.",

Especially with the pressure you are facing it seems reasonable for your brain to be a bit drained. \nAlso Try to self reflect upon the aspects that build the circumstances you are facing right now. Since depression often is so overwhelming were forced to see everything Grey scaled and drawing connections between moods and mental illness becomes alot harder. For example what exactly is bothering you about your job? Is it something about the job itself (Form of Labor, Customer Comment ect.) or something mental illness related (A situation accured that triggered your mental illness).",

When i was in hs i used to self harm, and when my mom found out i stopped out of embarrassment. i've relapsed once or twice, but recently i've had this crippling feeling of lonliness and sadness. I can hardly get out of bed to use the washroom or eat, even when i do get out of bed things like eating just aren't important to me or just feels like too much work. I can't do my school work, my body and braid just won't allow it, and this causes more sadness because of the anxiety of failing school and being worthless. Life just feels very heavy and i hate who i am, i don't feel like i have a future. I have no goals or real accomplishments and the friends that i have i just don't think are my people, i feel like i don't have anyone. I've never been able to talk to anyone about this because first of all i don't think anyone really hears or listens to me, and second its embarrassing. I hate the feeling of people feeling bad for me, so i suffer in silence. I've done this my whole life. How are some people just okay and happy with their lives? how do i get there? i feel like there will always be something or i'll always hate myself and suffer alone,.",

I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend and the guys I have tried to date end up being sleazy. I just want to be a homemaker and this college life isn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m just feeling lost because like what do I do? I haven\u2019t met the one, if I go home and quit school then I\u2019m just doing nothing\u2026 I just feel so stuck and lost in life. \nOn top of that I don\u2019t do any of my hobbies anymore. I live out of state and my mom refuses to help drive my things over so I can only brings stuff by airplane. I don\u2019t play piano anymore, I don\u2019t cook or bake which are things that make me really happy. \nI know someone is going to call me lazy but I swear that isn\u2019t the case.

When I look at myself I see that I, don't have a job, horrible in public settings and pretty much spend most the time I talk to him feeling envious of him. I'm a loser who doesn't really have a life to look forward too. I can tell my friend has developed over the past 3 years as well. We are both 21 but it feels very obvious that he has a more adult life. The way he talks to people is normal and he can start conversations with others well. While with me it's kinda just me being an awkward loser who tries to be funny. So my question to you all is. Should I just start slowly ghosting him so he can get me out of his life. I feel like I'm only holding him backhes made it clear that he hates people like me (not me specificall but how he described it, was basically like me) he's my only friend and I know ill be pretty lonely but should I?

 "text": "I'm not in a good headspace. Life in general. I've been through so much bullshit people don't even believe me anymore. My father abused my mom, and when she ran away, he started beating me. I told the schools when I was six, and they just turned around and told my dad everything I said. He told them I have a vivid imagination, and then proceeded to chuck me off of the roof of our house when, keep in mind, I was six years old. He hit me in the head with a metal bat when I was nine, shot me with a BB gun, tried to stab me, hit me in the head with beer bottles, and coming home from school to see him slouched over with a bottle of pills in his hand thinking he was dead wasn't fun either.\nUltimately became homeless at 12 and worked at a McDonald's on night shift when I did school during the day from 12-18, then stayed at McDonald's until the beginning of 2020 when I finally got a tax job. I could never go to homeless shelters because if the cops find you, they just drop you off at that the border of another state (I won't say which ones). I've seen it to many people I knew during my time on the street.\nNow I'm finally away from the worst parts of my life, but the trauma is even worse. I can't sleep. I can barely breathe. I have heart problems and I'm sure I'm just one bad day away from going into a mental breakdown. I've seen murders, assaults, mutilations and everything else. It's shown me the worst parts of humanities and also that the good parts are extremely few and far in between.\nNow that I'm relatively stable, about to both work and do college full-time, I wanted to give humanity another chance to prove me wrong, but I think it's finally pushed me to my breaking point. Europe is having the most deadly war since WWII and everybody's looking at it from a numbers and patriotism standpoint instead of a humanity standpoint. I seriously don't think I can do this much longer.\nUpdate: My grandfather passed away two nights ago after being in the hospital for three weeks. My uncle called and told me that he went in for a mild case of pneumonia. Two weeks after he's admitted, my uncle calls me and tells me out of nowhere that my grandpa's lungs and kidneys both have failed and that he's refusing dialysis. Now that he's passed, I found out that they've set his funeral on a day that I can't be there because my job only has two employees - me and my boss, and my boss is going to be halfway across the country, so there's literally no way I can go to it. I really needed some form of closure, because thanks to being in legal trouble with my dad, we had a restraining order, and he went to my grandmother's viewing and funeral, which meant I couldn't be there. Now I can't be there for my grandfather because nobody consulted me when they were planning the date of his stuff.\nThe slip and slidal moments are back. They've been gone for about a year or so, but they started again some time in late January. I've always resolved that I would only take my own life if I had a handgun capable of instant death (a .9mm or higher), but last night, I impulsive straight up got out of bed and went to find the knife in my utensil drawer (I only have one knife that isn't a butter knife), and it wasn't there, so after I spent five minutes or so looking for it, I finally came back to reality and spent the entire night sobbing my eyes out.\nIt's too much. I'll leave nothing behind when I pass and I'm completely okay with that. Nobody would even know what happened, because I've told them that I've been considering moving either to Wyoming or Germany, so if I just stopped being responsive they'll assume that I've moved and stopped ghosting everybody. I have the perfect plan to end everything in a place where nobody will find my body, so nobody would be traumatized by seeing a corpse out somewhere, but so far I've been able to resist. I don't know why. I don't want to be here. I don't want things to get better anymore, I just want to be gone.\nIt's just.. getting to be too much.",

I\u2019m going to start praying every night that I don\u2019t wake up in the morning.  My sole purpose on earth is working a job making a evil billionaire more billions.  This whole existence has no purpose or meaning.  You\u2019re born without your consent, then you experience trauma in early childhood that pretty much ruins any chance of having a happy/healthy life, then you get a job that pays you poorly and treats you like shit, then you find another human to procreate with, you bring another human in this world to go through the same bullshit you\u2019re going through and the cycle continues.  Trauma and addiction gets passed from generation to generation.  There is no greater good on planet earth.  I hate it here and just want it to be over. Life is something to get over with like a shift at work.",

This is a common occurrence for me when I\u2019m having   anxiety/depression  episodes. I just feel empty. I want a girlfriend more than anything in the world. As a 21 year old that\u2019s not a very common thing to want, but it\u2019s all I want. The apps don\u2019t work for me, no one swipes right which even I\u2019m kind of surprised by because I know I\u2019m not the worst looking person. It shoots me down hard and makes me feel like nothing. But when I talk to girls in real life they seem to enjoy talking to me as much as I enjoy talking to them. I\u2019ve gotten a few numbers from people in my classes and at the bar, but they haven\u2019t gone anywhere (yet). Idk the emptiness is starting to let in a cool breeze that I feel could turn me cold. The worst part is nobody put that hole there. It\u2019s just so heavy with love to give that it\u2019s turning it into hatred to take.",

I work at 3pm so for the past few months I\u2019ve literally been laying in bed for 12 hours. I work at a gym so working out helps me a lot, but as soon as I\u2019m home I would just feel like a lazy sack of meat and a failure. My friends are graduating and getting big boy jobs and I\u2019m just stuck. But recently I have started digging myself out of the hole. You have to realize what you\u2019re doing. The time that you should be using to better yourself and chase your dreams, you\u2019re using it instead to stress about what your family thinks and what the people around you are doing. Usually when you don\u2019t have any interest in school, you\u2019re a business man/ entrepreneur. I started a ATM business a few months ago and it\u2019s been great. It keeps me occupied when I\u2019m not at work, and the money motivates me to achieve financial freedom. All our friends who are in school are going to be 9-5 slaves until they\u2019re 65 and we don\u2019t want that life for ourselves, hence why we can\u2019t stay in a classroom lol. When you\u2019re successful and financially stable your family will realize you never needed a degree. Start taking risks and chances bc you\u2019re young. If you absolutely fucked up today, two years from now you\u2019ll be 25 and still young. Keep your head up and find your grind, a textbooks will not teach you how to live life!",

But lately my depression (which is severe and includes being suicidal) has gotten to the point where I'm disinterested in my cats and really just want them to leave me alone. I don't have those same feelings of adoration and affection toward them. Is this a normal thing to happen with depression? Is this like the last bit of life in me finally burning out?",

TW: self-harm i don\u2019t know what to do anymore atp that my thoughts are slowly just spilling and I\u2019m writing this as I\u2019m crying myself trying to sleep at 3:50 am. i can\u2019t stop thinking or imaging myself ways to die instantly because of school and just everything. I thought I was really doing better but guess not. Nothing gets better, people say it gets better maybe it does for a while but that\u2019ll go away. When can I stop feeling shit and stop overthinking about everything. I\u2019ve been failing school since the beginning of 10th grade this year, I don\u2019t have many friends and lost tons of friends in person because of how much I\u2019ve distance myself away from them because of my mental health and people at my school seems really nice but I\u2019m scared of being backstabbed. I\u2019ve tried everything to make myself get a better aspect of life or find things to change my view but nothing has worked. I hate it here so much. I dislike school because i feel different from everyone because I don\u2019t know how to do basic algebra or trigonometry regardless of how many times I\u2019ve tried studying it even after school hours, I hate having an learning disability and slow understanding. I\u2019m ugly truly, I\u2019ve been skipping school unexcused so many times and I\u2019m a online a student. How can a online student possibly fail online schooling? I\u2019m not even sure myself but I know that I\u2019m not even motivated just fucking myself over with these ruthless suicidal thoughts in my head and slowly giving up and just wanna end my life sooner. I\u2019m so sick and disgusted for even feeling this way because I know many kids/teenagers out there who want the privilege being accessed to free education,etc and they are probably going through way more than me.I just wanna get out of my body and be free. I love my family and gf/friends; they treat me well but I can\u2019t anymore going on. I\u2019m sorry whoever is reading this I was you well I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore.. i can\u2019t keep gaming as my therapy and to escape reality 24/7. My mind is feeding me up so much and I wanna visit my hamster and grandpa up there when I pass. Have a goodnight/goodmorning or good afternoon where ever you are.",

 "text": "Life fucks me up and I fuck up everything I touch. On top of being depressed since I was 13, I have had the worst fucking time starting from that point. I was *TW* sexually abusedand mentally abused by older friends starting from that age and since then I have never felt truly happy. I was bullied in school or overlooked as I was never physically or conventionally attractive. I went through an eating disorder. I watched one of my friends spiral into suicide. My ex drank herself to death for years while I just sat idly by, I was bullied by my family for my bisexuality, my best friend throughout middle and high school did her best to constantly replace me.\nDespite all of this, I really tried. I got straight A's in high school and managed to graduate with a 4.2, having club participation, and what I thought was a decent friend group. Then college hit and shit hit the fucking fan. I lost all of my friends during COVID because I closed myself off. I made an online friend group that I was basically the older sibling to and lost them from my own stupidity. I barely scraped by with Bs and a few As in my college courses.\nIn 2021, my mental health spiraled so bad my ex cheated on me despite loving me dearly and vice versa. After that occurred, my life just went downhill. I mulled over them for months while I closed myself off from friends. I fought with a friend and ultimately ended a toxic friendship. Things came to a head as my ex popped in and out of my life, until we finally parted in good terms a month before they found a new girlfriend. That same month, 4 friendships of 3+ years ended, I lost my grandmother (first death in the family since i was 12), and a month after, I lost my great aunt (who was my second grandma). Now I have very little friends and the few I have spend their days worrying for me. Ontop of that, I had to quit therapy due to not having money to pay for treatment, leaving my depression, anxiety, and potentially bipolar disorder left unchecked. Oh, and I think I'm falling in love with my best friend I can never have and failing my first semester of junior year of college.\nI fuck everything up. I blame myself for all of this and I can't take it anymore. I am losing my mind to the point of posting to this Reddit for who knows what. This probably doesn't even make sense because I just spilled everything out, and that isn't even the whole of it, just some. I don't know what to do anymore and even if this gets deleted, maybe one person will read it and have some sort of hope for me, because I do not.",

When, I have time alone, I pleasure myself to porn. But, nothing works. At the end of the day, the depression creeps back in. Going to or, talking to a therapist or psychiatrist doesn't help either. I saw a few shrinks years back & all they did was give me medication or, told me to find distractions. Total bullshit. The distractions aren't the ones I want & the meds make my hard on go bye bye.

They came back but I believe that stronger. Since 2021 my life has been like in uncertainity. In my house things with my mom have been weird and she has her own stuff going on. I do care for my family but sometimes i like to think about myself and ending this stuff.\nMy idea of talking over here is to see if I could talk to someone. People! I don't have the possibility of paying a psychologist. I have been attended by a psychiatrist and I believe the pills they prescripted are not functioning thus my next appointment is on august 2023. IDK if you know but psycologist and psychatrist are different stuff so I don't really have help from them. Many people got spiritual help but I feel so so bad that I don't wanna move from bed. If I move, it's because my mom or grandma needs me for anything; besides that, I don't want to do anything.\nMy mom has her own situation with suicide plus anorexia and she has been going through some stuff from work. If I talk to her I know that I will do anything but help her. I don't want to say anything to my best friend. I study at the University but I have done nothing the past 8 weeks I believe, many would think within my social circle that I am exaggerating or just being a total vagabond.\nI don't want to bother my mom with my stuff, I shall be affecting her much more than what she is currently going through. My dad is not even part of this equation, I have his contact and I talked to him maybe an hour ago and he does not care at all. What scares me the most is that in my house there is some medication without usage that if I lose my conscious mind, would drink and lead to a sleepy death with an overdose.\nMy best friend lives far away from me and I saw her more than a month ago. I love her so much because maybe she is the only one I could talk about. But she can barely do anything for me. Much of our friendship, since we graduated in 2021 has become virtual. Besides that I got no friends to talk, I am crying right now. My grandma has cirrhosis which is a sickness that has no cure and I know that she'll die maybe sooner and I don't want that.\nI can't go to church because I feel so lazy that I can barely do anything. I saw about manifestation and started practicing it but I got sort of disappointed idk. I must be by now tidying up and cleaning my room because when I pass away I want everything to be clean but I am lazy to do so. I had so much plans but i feel very bad, broke, and without hope. Now I don't even know if God exists",

A lot of people are alone in college (despite what the media would have us believe about college being the best years of your life). But you might want to look at your interactions with people you tried to become friends with to see if you notice any patterns. Were you just trying with the wrong people (people who wouldn't be a good fit for friendship or weren't looking for new friends)? Did you come on too strong/expect a good friendship to form too quickly (that's my problem often)? \nKeep going to some of those clubs, though. Even if you don't make good friends out of it, it'll give you something to do and a sense of purpose. I worked for the student radio station in undergrad, and even though it only resulted in a couple of very loose friendships, it was still nice to see people when I went to the studio.",

 "text": "I hate being alive You have to be grateful for things and work hard. You have to make smart decisions to survive. You have to work and you have to give a shit about the people that are around you. You have to force yourself to try to have fun. Having fun is a chore and so is being alive. I don't know how much longer I am going to have to deal with having a family to call and having people from my past that I should probably talk to or reconnect with but I just don't want to put forth the effort. I don't want to be emotionally attached to other people in any way and I get no pleasure from them. I'm tired of having to buy shit to survive and I'm tired of having to pretend to be happy to be studying something or getting into a field that makes more money, because at the end of the day I don't really give a shit about where I am in life in the next five, ten, twenty years. I don't care about owning a home or getting a pet and I don't care about doing anything or accomplishing anything. They say you only live once but I just don't give a shit. When you die everything just goes black and so everything that you experience in this life is ultimately completely meaningless anyways. There's nothing to gain from life whatsoever.\nThere is no real reward for living life and there is no way to enjoy it. You have to force yourself to enjoy it and that's too much work. What is the point in caring about anything? I only care about things for superficial reasons and the more I live on my own in this adult life the more I really think I would rather be dead than worry at tall about doing what I have to do in order to take care of myself and survive. I just don't give a shit but I have to in order to avoid suffering. I have to give a shit about brushing my teeth in order to not experience chronic tooth pain, etc. It applies to everything. There is no point to anything and there is no point in trying to help other people because no matter what there will always be someone else in this world who can also help others in a similar way to caring about that is pointless. I would rather isolate myself from everyone else as much as possible because giving a fuck about other people is too heavy. I would rather not be involved in other people's lives because giving a shit about other people is too heavy of a thing and I don't want there to be any weight in my life. Because if you die than everything you lived for is gone forever and you enter the eternal void of darkness, so why bother getting involved with other people in the first place. \nI just don't give a shit about anything man. It's not worth giving a shit about anything. Having interests and being a novice about anything is just humiliating as it is and I don't know. All of this shit is completely pointless and there's really nothing interesting at all about what happens in the world or living life every day. I mean what is the point? I don't give a shit about love. I don't give a shit about sex. I don't feel a thing when I see an attractive woman. That doesn't give me any pleasure. I don't feel a thing when I accomplish a task. That doesn't give me pleasure. I don't want to talk to my family or my \"friends\" who don't really want to talk to me either because I don't feel positive emotions towards other people and I avoid all feelings of love for anything and that includes people. There's not reason to do anything really. \nLiterally every little thing about life is a burden and you are expected to pretend to be happy and caring. Well I don't care and that's not really my choice either. Nothing in this world or in life in general is worth caring about and everything you have to do in life is always a burden, something that sucks out all of your energy. And even getting that energy by going to sleep is also a burden. Having to manage your time and go to sleep at an appropriate time so that you both get enough of it and so that you are well rested by the time you need to be for whatever you have to do the next day is just another example of a burden.\nLife is all about existence getting worse and worse as time goes on. Every additional responsibility you acquire makes life worse. And that's all life is, is acquiring more and more responsibilities. Why bother with any of it really? What is the point in giving a shit besides the avoidance of suffering? This is why I don't have any empathy for people who suffer in this world. It's usually your own choices that lead to that suffering and I've suffered a fair amount due to my own bad choices. So if I end up homeless and starving sure that sucks but I will man up and do something about it. I don't really give a shit about anyone who doesn't have food because they spent their money on more expensive shit that they wanted to eat rather than on bare necessities that would provide them with enough nutrition to get through the day. I don't know. But that's all life is, is shit getting worse. You lose your hair, you need to work harder to make more money, or you need to learn about stuff to make money in a smarter way, which is further burdensome in and of itself. There's nothing to be proud of in this world either. There is nothing I could do that I could look at potentially and think to myself wow, I am proud of myself. No, I'll never feel pride for anything because non of it matters. If you accomplish a positive thing the only thing that actually matters is if you avoided suffering because of it. There is nothing to be passionate about in life and there is no reason to be grateful that you are subjected to life in general.",

The \"Rollercoaster\" of ups and downs I'm told is your body trying to adjust to the new levels of Serotonin building up on your system. That can take 2-12 weeks to stabilize. Everyone reacts differently. \nThe fluctuations in feeling tired might be due to the half-life of Lexapro. It does need to be taken consistently and build up on your system and the stabilize. \nI see some people play with taking it in the morning or at night. I suppose that depends on if they feel tired during the day or if taking at night makes them unable to sleep. \nCheck out the Lexapro section on here though. You won't run out of topics to drive yourself crazy over. I'd suggest reaching out more to your Dr. Reading too much can make you overwhelmed.",

I get so embarrassed I just want to disappear and be invisible.  I feel so alone. Nobody wants to be around the person who's always in trouble so I eat alone, walk alone and do everything alone. It fucks with my head. It gets so bad I noticed I can't focus on what's going on in the moment and I can't listen to everything because I'm zoned out, I miss more important information and then I continue messing up. Then I notice I stop eating and drinking water and I neglect myself because I don't feel I deserve it until I fix the issue.  Then I zone out and think about what I should do the next time, and try to think about everyone who cares about me. I have one friend and he cares about me and he calls me often but I noticed he only talks about himself and he keeps me on the phone for two hours each time and I don't have that free time and it punishes me mentally to hear him talk about himself and not let me  say anything but he's a kind person. I usually don't mind being alone but I need human interaction. I have an online girlfriend in another country I knew her for 10 years but now after all this time she's too lazy to meet in person and she says I can't visit her, and because she doesn't meet me halfway I completely lost interest in her and now I don't know how or if I should tell her because have almost no one in my life.

I know in most situations, complete honesty send up red flags and freaks people out, but there's nothing you can say to an inpatient counselor that they haven't heard before.  The more details you can give and the more honesty you bring into the process, the better.  They can't help you fix the problems if they don't know what the problems are.  Respect the fact that everyone there is fighting their own battles, and take advantage of the idea that this may be the only time you'll be surrounded by people who actually have a real idea of what you're going through.",

 "text": "I\u2019m feeling worthless and down a lot lately and would like some perspectives that come from other people that could help me become stronger or challenge my difficult feelings I\u2019m currently recovering from a really bad anxious collapse that happened me over a year ago now. My mother had me when she was 20 (single mother) and met another man who she married and had my 3 siblings with. I never met my biological dad and gre up looking different to my peers. This caused me to be bullied by 4 different groups throughout my teens. I drank and used drugs to cope from 13-20 until I got brought to court and it was a wake up call. I went back to university as an adult, even got a scholarship after undergrad to go to another country but I never really felt confident about who I am or that I had any worth. Especially to women. I had one relationship in my 20s that lasted almost 5 years. I dated someone who I wasn\u2019t really physically attracted to. I did love her, she had a kind heart and took care of me. I always felt guilty though about not really feeling physical attraction for her. I think subconsciously I must have thought that the only type of love I was worthy of was from someone I would not feel attracted to or my perception that she was not what I felt was attractive meant she was less likely to abandon me. I know how narcissistic and awful that sounds trust me. I\u2019m just trying to be honest. When that relationship ended I decided that if I was going to date anyone again I must be attracted to them physically in some way at least. \nFast forward 6 years and I haven\u2019t been on a date since. I could count on one hand the amount of times I\u2019ve even been hugged since then. All my life I\u2019ve felt invisible to women. I really wanted to meet someone and start a family. I thought \u201cmost people meet someone eventually and get married, that will probably happen me too\u201d, well, it hasn\u2019t\nNow my focus is on trying to figure out ways of managing life with no one there to complement me, encourage me, or think of me for the next 20 years. Which is how it\u2019s been for most of the last 20. Sometimes I feel so down and sad. It\u2019s really tough trying to reassure yourself when you get so little validation from others. I feel like I will have to explain over and over to people in the future that I\u2019m not married and don\u2019t have a family. It makes my eyes fill with tears because I don\u2019t know why no women seemed to want me that I showed interest in. I don\u2019t know if it was looks or personality or my anxious standoffishness. \nI feel resentful when I hear about people who screwed people over and treated people badly while I was growing up now having wives and a couple kids, and the feel like I\u2019m worthless. When I was younger I felt bad because I felt invisible to girls then too. I don\u2019t think as people we were designed to be alone but I feel such strong rejection now that I have decided to give up on my hopes of having a family and try to find ways to live alone and be happy. I had the idea that I could donate some of my earnings to children in need anonymously as a way to show love to children. I also want to volunteer somewhere as a way to help I. The community. I really feel like the only way to experience less emotional pain in the future is by limiting the amount of interaction I have with people and keep to myself because when I see others with the things I\u2019m not able to achieve it gives me deep feelings of sadness. I\u2019m go to therapy and take medication but I\u2019m just r stuck and not feeling any better",

Have you seen a mental health specialist? \nThere are treatments for this, including certain meds, cognitive behavioral therapy, or transcranial magnetic stimulation. You might not find the right treatment at first, and might have to try different ones before you find the one that works, but you can get better. \nI finally stumbled on the right combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine, sometimes referred to as California rocket fuel. Those are two different antidepressants. They are often used together for treatment-resistant depression, and venlafaxine by itself is often used for anxiety.",

I'm studying to get into medical College and i have been preparing for it since 2021. Basically, mom had me choose this stream, i wanted to do something related to arts, but i ended up doing what mom said anyways. I used to study till last year, just because i didn't want to get embarassed in class, and i haven't failed any of my exams, but i still dont want to do anything related to medical. Now I'm feeling really tired of studying for something i don't want to do. I feel like I'm wasting my time for nothing. My classes ended in Nov, now since jan-feb, whole day i just feel like sitting on one place and stare into nothing. Mom expects me to study all the time so i just open my book in front of me and keep staring out of the window whole day. I don't have any friends so i don't have anyone to talk to, i used to love reading, baking, drawing, gaming but now i have completely lost interest in doing any of those, also I'm not allowed to do that, like i said mom expects me to study all the time. I literally haven't left my house for 2 years, except for school/classes. Mom tells me to study till at least 3 am and wake up by 7, then only I will get admission in good college, so i stay up till then just to satisfy my mom so i barely get 3-4 hrs of sleep everyday. And i just feel so tired of this, i just want all this to end. Even if i decide that maybe i should try to study for atleast an hour, my mind just wanders off somewhere else, i have zero concentration for few months. I keep wishing that i wasn't born and hope that something happens with me so i don't have to deal with this anymore. Also i feel really guilty that my mom spent so much for my school, books, etc and i cant even concentrate for 5 min. I feel bad that mom has spent so much money for education on someone like me, im done with my finals and i have passed those, but the entrance exams for college i keep wishing i fail cuz if i get admission in med college then i will be wasting my 5 years but if i fail mom's gonna be so disappointed in me. Idk i just feel guilty for cheating my mom like that, and i feel so pathetic for feeling like this, since I'm not the only one \"preparing\" for medical.\nAnyways ty for reading guys",

It is hard, but really it's your life, and imo you should strive to first and foremost make yourself happy.

I appreciate it but i don't think other things are gonna work, cuz i need to listen to what my mom says otherwise i get yelled at. Getting a pet, going out for a walk is gonna be distracting and all for me. 2 years back my sis did told my mom that maybe she should take me to psychiatrist since i might have social anxiety but mom just said stuff like nothing's wrong with me, I'm fine, so idk about that.",

Here we go. \nRegarding my present, I am 25, living with my girlfriend and her dad. I work in a little casino in a deprived area that actively makes people's lives worse, but I can't leave because of money. My girlfriend convinced me to do a degree in History because I love the subject however now I am at the point where I feel like this was a mistake because the job prospects are dismal. I have no friends. My life is work, uni work and hang out with my girlfriend.\nRegarding my future, what future do I have to look forward to? I have absolutely no purpose in life. I do not want kids. I wish I did, but I don't. I most likely will not have a fulfilling career. I probably won't make a lot of money. So what is the point? I might as well kill myself because I can already map out how my life is going, and it is not positive at all.",

The other tricks you into thinking that there are many other players and a cohesive world. (Reality)\nThis is my understanding. I think that reality becomes less fearful and depressing when we see it as a sort of dream that is just a little more structured. \nWe still have power over it, but it takes patience and diligence to make any progress. We have to learn to give up our need for a quick fix and for perfection and achievement or love. We need to learn to consistently come back to the present and to develop a grateful heart. Stop being so fucking selfish & spread a little joy. Do you want to be a part of the problem or the solution?",

I felt a little pressured by a friend to go to Spain since he came here with his family and people from my country isn't accepted in the USA due to so many people already there, I don't have as much money as my friend has and I'm constantly estressed about money, I went from spending $30 per month to spend over $250 and in my first three weeks I spent $700. I'm constantly worried about losing all my savings that are just enough to be here for a year maybe before having to find something in real life, the job situation is not the best here and I have to share appartment with other people and is constantly estressing me out.\nThere are still days when I'm just thinking about laying in bed to just die or go ahead and drown in a river, I thought I would somehow stop thinking about this stuff once here but it has actually gotten worse and I'm even thinking about going back to my awful country to die there instead... I feel so alone all the time wherever I go, I can't talk to people, I can't make friends, I don't know for how long I'll be able to support this.\nI'm 25yo, I wasn't able to go to college, my parents are old and a little crazy still in my country now alone since I'm a single child, these are just some of the things I'm constantly thinking about every day, I even feel bad for the food that I buy like there are days I don't want to eat just to save the meal.",

(Also have body image issues due to life long criticism by family members/recovered from EDs)\n-I am coming out of a deep depression spiral where nothing was appealing to me, not interested in people, hobbies, living, etc. \nI'm finally feeling better so we decided to go out as a family, me, husband, and our 10 year old. We're trying on shoes having a hell of a fun time, until I try on shoes and they decide to roast me. \n-The first pair I tried on, my husband said if I buy/wear them he wouldn't be seen in public with me. He was not joking. Look of disgust included, free of charge.\n Our child decided to make gagging noises at them. \n-The second pair I tried on I was told I would never wear them anywhere because they don't fit my \"sad personality\" and I look like a \"depressed stormtrooper.\"\nLike WTF. I actually liked both pair of shoes and they fit who I truly am when I'm not hiding. \nMind you the store was very busy and multiple people heard them say this to me and looked at me with absolutely crushing pity. \n-I know it seems silly to be upset over shoes, but that's not it. I was actually genuinely happy and excited by something and haven't been in a long time.\n-Needless to say I have been silent since leaving the store. Like if I can't express myself with the people I'm supposed to be safe and supported by, wtf am I supposed to do?\n- I'm trying to not let this knock me off the positive path I'm on now, or be too sensitive about it but it's bothering me a lot.\nThoughts and opinions?",

I sat in my room alone as I started to ask myself \u201cam I real\u201d I went on Google and searched up what I was feeling the more posts I read the more I felt exactly how those people in the comment section felt. I felt like I was high and was about to faint. But I read Thoughts of those who said they wanted to die or those who said a lot of other things. I even called the suicidal hotline, as I am writing this I am starting to feel the symptoms again but this time I know better. To those of you who are struggling at the moment this might not be much help to you but it helped me today you do not need to stop thinking negative thoughts because the more you try the more it\u2019ll be instead focus your thoughts on something I know it\u2019s hard but even talking to someone at the moment might help you. Please and I mean please get yourself a therapist if you have not done so I am not a professional but today made me realize how important and intense suicidal thought can be. Your mind is one of the strongest weapons to ever exist and sometimes that weapon may turn against you, but it will not prosper. You\u2019re mind is very powerful and the things that you go through just proves that, your thoughts are not your reality and if you have not done so I advise you to go on YouTube and listen to Sadhguru he has helped me today. And I hope he\u2019ll help you too. I hope that soon you\u2019ll be okay enough to even leave this chat if you feel like. I hope you\u2019ll be happy again. I hope you\u2019ll have control over your life again and have a will to live. I hope you get better.",

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and to struggle with doing things that used to come easily to you.\nIt's great that you're trying to make positive changes by not smoking today, but please don't beat yourself up if you don't feel instantly better. Recovery is a process, and it takes time and effort to get to a better place.\nIt might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through. They can provide you with strategies for managing your symptoms, as well as help you work through any underlying issues that might be contributing to how you're feeling.\nIn the meantime, try to be kind to yourself. Allow yourself to rest and take things one day at a time. Remember that it's okay to ask for help, and that you don't have to go through this alone.\nI care about you and I'm here to support you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you ever need someone to talk to.\nFYI: I used to smoke for 15 years and it\u2019s been 2 years since I quit, I feel much better now.",

In the last year i started regularly going to therapy, and found some meds that work really well, and entered a new relationship with a very realistic but optimistic person (26, psych major for counseling and therapy, what a duo lol)\nWithin the last few months i cant help but feel impending doom. On the days where I\u2019m okay and my medication helps, i am great.\nOn the bad days its just exhausting. Ive been with my partner for over a year now, this is the healthiest relationship Ive ever had. I see endgame with him. We\u2019ve had little bumps but nothing we cant work through.\nWe both graduate in may (grad school for him) and i am just feeling major senioritis. I dont know what to do after school. Work until i die? When i was a preteen i didnt think i was going to make it to 18 so, what now?\nAgain, the days that are good are good, but some days i just feel that I\u2019ve messed up beyond repair. Ive messed my life up, or I\u2019m too messed up. My bf shows he loves me and is very understanding, but i feel insecure lately because i just love him so much and i feel like my mental problems will bring him down or make him sick of me. He says its not and that we\u2019re okay and I\u2019m okay.

It is so painful to be aware of my impulsive thoughts and overthinking and anxious attachment style because i know its an issue and theres \u201cnothing\u201d i can do about it, and i feel like being aware of it will just manifest it.\nIts cyclical and sickening, i have a weight on my chest and it paralyzes me. I am so afraid of letting myself sabotage a relationship bc its going \u201ctoo smoothly\u201dthat i fear i am doing just that. Its so exhausting to be self aware. \nI am on meds that help and in therapy, and i WANT to be better, but i just cant make it go away. Now that im in my 20s im convinced it never will. I feel like a Sim doing my tasks every day just to make it to the next day",

 "text": "I don't see myself living for much longer I've made this throwaway as a couple of people I know know my main Reddit account. I'm 25 years old and have been living away from home for almost a year. I'm from Ireland but am living in London after following a big career opportunity, and so far it's going ok. A lot of downs, but a few ups so I guess it's all been balancing out.\nI guess I don't really have a segue to saying this, but I don't feel like I can live for much longer. I've no health complications/issues, I'm relatively healthy physically, but mentally I'm not ok. I feel sad and lonely a lot of the time. My family and girlfriend are back home and I miss them so much. I've noticed I've been drinking a lot over the last few months (not always getting shitfaced, but having something to get the lightest buzz) and whenever I visit home I smoke weed most nights. These substances make me feel a lot better than I do without.\nI've ticked off a number of things on my bucket list such as see my favourite band live, meet said favourite band, work in my desired career field, find a partner I feel happy with, move out of my parents house, etc. I know my bucket list isn't super exciting or long, but I can't think of anything else to add on to it.\nI spend most weekends at my flat, browsing the internet aimlessly and trying to find something to do with my couple of days off. Admittedly, a few weeks ago I'd gone out with a friend of mine for a few drinks and when I was waiting for my train to arrive, all I could think about was ending my life. It just came out of nowhere, I wasn't even feeling sad or helpless, it came into my head and took over - clearly I didn't act upon it. Since then I've realised that I don't see myself living much longer. I don't have a plan for ending my life, but I can't see myself living to 30 (that's only five years away). I struggle to plan for things that are less than a year away becasuse I put so little thought into the future, I just try and plan things day-by-day or week-by-week.\nI haven't expressed any of this with anyone in my life because I don't see them often or else they live back home, and I don't want to scare anyone. I don't really know what to do with myself.",

It wouldn't unfortunately be exactly like flying, but it might give you a means to engage in a hobby that your kids could also participate in. You need some time to unwind, really any time you can get, because if you don't, it'll just get more and more exhausting to live life.\nIt'll also make your life more difficult if you let this nostalgia over a past relationship consume you, but the only way you can overcome this is by making a change in your married life. If you want to continue your marriage, seek marriage counseling. If you don't, seek separation. Either way, you need to talk to your wife and express exactly how you feel.\nI wish you all the best, OP. If you can take a break today, take a walk or hang out with your kids. Whatever can make you feel just a bit of happiness.",

 "text": "I lost my uncle last night, 4 months after I lost my aunt (his wife) To preserve my privacy, I will refer to my uncle as \"R\", and my aunt as \"C\"\nIf you were to scroll far enough on my account, you would find the post I made the night C died, and how I felt that night. Overall, I felt fine, purely down to shock. I was not very close to C but if I bumped into her while she was at work, I would stop and say hello, or speak to her during parties. It was a rough time for my family, and very challenging for me to work through due to it being the first substantial death in my family, one that really affected me due to the reactions around me, and the utter guilt I felt from not experiencing grief. She died on the 20th of December, 5 days before Christmas, after falling into a sudden coma despite being overall healthy. The immediate news didn't affect me at all, nor the announcement of her death, but the funeral broke me. I had a panic attack as the curtain was drawn to transfer her coffin into the furnace. The next day, I overdosed.\nR died yesterday during a car jumpstart by just simply slumping over, and dying (heart attack). He was revived, but soon took another one and that was the end of his life. He was taken as quickly as C was, Many of my family members believe he died of a broken heart, which makes the entire situation so much worse for me to work through. It would be selfish of me to be upset about his death due to maybe speaking to him once or twice in my life, but when we used to talk about the couple, they were always talked about together, never individually, so for example, \"I'm going to C and R's house.\". I haven't really managed to grieve C's death, so grieving R's too is going to be so tough. I'm not nearly as mentally unwell as I was at the time of C's death, so this hasn't pushed me over the edge as far as I'm currently aware, but I'm sure I'll be able to figure that out after the initial shock has worn off\nTo finish, I am not a religious person, so I can't lean back on the idea that they have been reunited in heaven, however much I would love to take comfort in that idea. I wish I was religious to an extent so that I could have an answer or at least a sense of relief that they're together forever, but it's a cold, lonely world that I live in, and I know that this is the final journey. I know that as soon as C's eyes closed to submit to her coma, that was the last time R ever looked into his wife's soul.\nI'm getting too deep here, I apologise. I'm just upset.",

Try not to let negative thoughts take over and instead focus on your strengths and the things that make you unique. It's okay to take some time for yourself, but also consider reaching out to your friends and spending time with them. They may be more supportive than you think.\nFinally, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone has their own struggles and insecurities, and it's okay to be imperfect.

He passed away almost 3 years ago and in the time we have celebrated him more than I have ever been celebrated. Mom and I were watching tv the other day and she remarked that she never had birthday parties growing up. I said neither did I. She disagreed telling me about all these parties until I pointed out that those parties were for my brother and sometimes sister. Then it was the same lecture I got after he died: \u201cit\u2019s not that he was the favorite it\u2019s just that he had a special relationship with my parents that me and my sister could never experience because he saved their marriage/made them parents/he was the only son.\u201d My birthday is usually forgotten because it\u2019s right around Thanksgiving. I had a sweet sixteen that wound up being more of a family party with pink decorations. \nBeing the one never chosen has effected me forever. I was such a pick me it must have been annoying. I was chosen first once in my life:by my husband, the greatest person I know. And I feel like he\u2019s lived to regret that choice. I\u2019ve tried to make life what we wanted but it seems to kick us in the ass at every turn because of me: employment issues for both but especially for me, medical issues on my side, two miscarriages in the last 2 years, living with our families the last 8 years of our 11 year marriage. And he\u2019s broken I think. \nNow he\u2019s going back to drinking and watching porn/playing pornographic video games constantly lying about it to me. I beg for his touch and attention but who would want a middle aged fat useless barren wife to look forward to coming home to?",

Since i was a kid i'm struggling with episodes of depression and anxiety, now, i am at the point when i just don't know what to do anymore. Somedays i just feel good and i say to myself \"yeah ok everything's gonna be alright you can make it\" and then, the day after it or even the same evening i just feel like i'm not able to do anything, i just lay in the bed and let the time go away. Also i'm having some problems with staying sober. Everyday after school, if i don't have weed to smoke i drink alcohol, if there is no alcohol i smoke weed, no matter what i just can't stay sober. And if i have to, i'm just angry all the time and avoid anyone, i just lay in the bed. I have hobbies and interests, even a dream work (psychiatrist lol), but i don't have the motivation to pursue them, so i'm always \"the same\". Hope someday i'll figure out how to make it all work.\nThank you.",

I think the fact that I was \"supposed\" to be happy and celebrating but could only see how far I was from happiness.\nAnxiety might be the main cause of your breathing issues.\nIt's obvious that you need a friend to vent with.  I know how important that is.  I am in the same boat.  I have people to talk to but they either don't want to deal with my shit or they simply don't know how to.  My parents just shrug and tell me they don't know what to do.\nWhich just makes me feel worse.\nIf you want to vent, I'm here to listen.  I'm hoping this sub can help me, too.",

 "text": "Is it possible to get therapy from your college? Many colleges offer free counseling / therapy services for students. It's definitely something to look into while you're a student.\nRegardless, I really hope you feel better soon. If possible, pick up one thing that you can do that could help you feel better. Whether it's a pre-existing hobby or a new one, having something to do can help take your mind off of things and provide you with a source of joy, even if it's just for a little while. It may not solve your problems, but such a thing can help provide a little bit of relief.\nTreasure your mom and dad and spend time with them if you can. Whenever you feel ready, try to find friends in your area / college that can also provide you joy and support. Don't rush into socialization, especially since you aren't feeling well right now. \nTry to take it easy and just do what you need to do to survive. It's okay. You'll thank yourself for it later. Take small steps towards improving your mental health and your situation; change doesn't need to be immediate for it to be powerful and long-lasting.\nPlease don't give up. Take it slow and steady. Don't pressure yourself, especially during such a hard time. Give yourself the love you deserve.",

Why can't you hang on break and lunch or after school?\nIt's OK to feel these things, feelings and emotions just are what they are. Usually to tell us that something is off so we can attend to it. Unfortunately our emotions don't know what can be changed and what can't.\nIf you can't change it, you must accept it and use it to your advantage, not let it cause you a disadvantage.\nIt might be just what you need! You might meet a girl and hangout with her. Or now that you don't have too many distractions you can FOCUS on school and get good grades, graduate with honors, geta accepted to a better college and give you a better future.\nWho knows though right?... you can just sit back and watch and cry as it crumbles around you because you don't do anything about it....

I have had small/minor bouts, but never anything this long term. I am typically a happy go lucky, outgoing, social person. Right now I feel so unlike myself. This depression had caused me to push important people in my life away. I\u2019ve said things I don\u2019t mean and I don\u2019t even know why. Why do we do these things when we are feeling this way? Why push people away when you need them most? I said things that are so hurtful. I can\u2019t take them back. Now the one person I had to lean on is gone.. because of the stupid stuff my mouth spewed when I was upset. I never want to hurt anyone. Especially when it some one I love. Dealing with a depression on top of a heartache feels so heavy, and I know it\u2019s my own fault. My hopes to anyone going through something similar, is to try and open up to the people who care. Do be stubborn and push them away. You don\u2019t want to lose them.",

Every culture has different standard, heck everyone has different standard. There are success story of certain parenting style, yet the same style is frowned upon elsewhere.\nBecause of it, there's no way to \"certify\" parents on how to raise kids. That means it makes sense for parents to raise their kids just like themselves, it's what they already know. Why would they try to experiment on their own kids? There's no guarantee other style would work better.\n\u200b\nI don't know why people romanticized adoption nowadays, be it human or pet. It sounds noble but not without trouble. Orphaned kids (or pet) tend to have mental issue like us. If a couple willing to do so, that's great, but most parents barely know how to raise normal kids.",

I thought I was getting better to be honest. Maybe I was, maybe I did get better but no matter what I do I always end up here. I get better but everytime I do I get worse as well. It's like im rising and the more I rise the harder I plummet. I'm so sick and tired of this. I really do want to give up, I cant take it anymore but I dont wanna leave my boyfriend. I wanna have a future with him, but I cant do this anymore.  I dont even know what to do in the future. I dont know what to do in the future, im going to college next year and I dont even know what course to take. I want to give my boyfriend everything in the future but I don't know how to, because I dont even know what career to do in the future. I dont have anything that im actually passionate about. I don't have anything that drives me. My boyfriend and my dog are the only reason I'm still here. This week I feel like my world revolves around my boyfriend. It's probably because im unconsciously clinging to my last reason to live. Im unconsciously making him my everything because I know that if I dont, I might actually do it. I ran out of motivation and reasons to live. He is the last reason and I'm clinging to it. Why cant I get better? I've been wanting to end it since I was 10 or 11 and now I'm 17 and im still suffering. Im still stagnant. I cant do this anymore. I promised him that I wont hurt myself, but I did 5 days ago and I did it again 20 minutes ago. I'm such a bad girlfriend, I feel like I'm draining him out because I keep telling him all my problems. I'm not doing well at school, I have been numb for days and then I was trying to study Math and it triggered me. I just started to breakdown because I cant understand it. How am I supposed to have a nice future If I cant even understand math. I'm not doing well with my family either nor with friends. My family keeps comparing me to my greatest friend and it's bs. My family isn't content with my scores nor with anything with me. I'm trying my best to get out of bed yet my family is here complaining about how I didn't get a perfect score or something. My family knows that my grandpa has been harassing me for years yet they turn a blind eye to it. My family emotionally abuses me and I cant take it. I want to stop caring about everyone's feelings but I cant leave my boyfriend. I really dont want to leave him. I'm trying hard to keep holding on but I just cant.",

How does one deal with it? How important is it to be patient when dealing with depression?\nDepression affects everyone differently. Sometimes it's been inside the whole time, waiting to strike at the right moment. Other times it's something that will never really go away because of things beyond our control. This is my summary of how I've been feeling over the last couple months after 10+ years of hurt.\n\nI wasn't always like this. I used to dream of using technology to improve the world. Used to spend hours beat mixing albums and organizing / editing photos. Used to see value in working for a pittance. Used to be independent. Some people even say I used to smile in photographs. Not anymore. None of that matters when life feels like it's not progressing at all. What do you do when everything feels pointless?\nThe only thing keeping me going is a close group of friends who do stuff on weekends. Nothing else matters more than having people who will support my struggles, who I'd do the same for in return. The thought or actuality of losing those friends scares the crap out of me. I know the only constant in life is change, but Autophobia is real and hurts so much.\nNow, living at home isn't so bad; rent is cheap, we have family meals, and people are around. However, I can't help but feel like doing the same thing with the same people in the same house for 3+ decades is part of the problem. Our worldly socio-economic policies don't help either, but I know I can't change those so I'm trying not to focus on them too much.\nPart of me wants to move out, both to grow and live life to its fullest. However, I'm also deathly afraid of moving out without someone who will help keep my mind grounded, remind me to function, and be there when (not if) I have another mental breakdown. It's not my friends responsibility to watch over me, but I need friends around to help qualm my Autophobia.\nAll we can do is learn to cope with each passing day. I'm still at home, learning to cope as best I can, all while trying to find the motivation to move forward with life, whatever that looks like. I hope you can find peace in your life too, because we all deserve to live a fulfilling life with as little complications as necessary.",

I could tell you more about what I do, breathing, meditating, walking outside, exercise sometimes, maybe one of those works?

I realize you want to be comforted, and that sometimes it might be lonely, might suck not getting friends/family to comfort you. But, getting outside of yourself, and comforting someone else can feel good, too... but I'm sending some positive thoughts to you...",

I always hear stories of people who have made suicide attempts and despite the outcome of how it failed, are glad they survived it.\nBefore i was even 10, i made an attempt, failed. I was poor, my parents separately abandoned me and raised their own kids. I did all these checklist things. I found people who love me and regularly show they love me, lasting throughout more than a decade now. I went to school, got a doctorate. My job appreciates me (i feel) and i make 6 figures, a long way from dropping a gallon of milk and not being able to afford more for a week. I went to therapy, tried medications. I bought a new car, bought a house i wanted. Ive traveled alone, traveled internationally with friends. I go out, i socialize, i meet people and try to learn about their different human experiences. I sing karaoke and the crowd cheers, even though im not even vocally talented. I have people who regularly tell me and show me that they are there for me or at least can help or guide me. The worst part of my days are really just inconveniences or annoyances. I have my cat and my dog that are 11 and 14 respectively, ive had then since they were babies and they are well and happy and i think that also says a lot about me as a person. Most of the time i feel like i am genuine to myself and my values. Its a good life. \nBut even after all this, i was never glad my attempt failed. Everyday i wake and do things because its expected. The only thing that keeps me going is not wanting to bring sadness to anyone that loves me. I feel like its the only part of me that isnt truthful or genuine. I dont know why i dont love anything or anyone. I just say i love you to people because i couldnt bring any sadness to anyone that does love me. I cant bring myself to tell anyone that i dont love then back. \nIm stuck because i thought this is what i wanted to finally be happy and to love. I cant think of a better job. Or what more i could want from the people that surround me. I dont know what more i even want from me (except to be grateful or love something or just damn be happy). Between luck opportunity and hard work, i have a good life.\nBut still, I regret the attempt hadnt worked out.",

I feel really depressed and have experienced my first anxiety attack ever. Ever since I finished my degree I've been financially stressed but kept my just above water. Now this is my first time posting ever, and also I'm just so confussed about everything so sorry if this doesn't really makes sense.\nRecently though it feels as if my life is falling completely apart. My wife, the love of my life, and I do LARP with our group. Now, last time we went I got really tired, and we ended up having a fight when we got back home from the event. And that fight became the drop that made my glass overflow. My ex and I broke up after a LARP event because we had a fight and she ended up cheating on me, it wasn't very pretty and has left me with a fear of being left behind and loosing people.\nDuring the last event we went to, my wife's character got engaged to one of our very good friends' character. That on top of the fight, have apparently reignited my fears from my former trauma of the way my ex left me. They have been doing forum rp daily ever since the event so that their characters can get to know each other better; something we generally do in the group, but the added romantic relationship between my wife and friends' characters. At the same time, because of my fears I have started growing slightly possessive and am really working with that issue as well as the other issues I have. We've spent some time apart to try and deal with my fear of not being with her, in case she might leave then, and are currently apart again while she's gone to visit some friends.\nDuring these days however, it feels as if she's been withdrawing from me, not really answering me proberly or outright choosing to not engage with me in regards to any forum play we've been doing or in general, while I know she's been continuing with her own forumplay. My mind continues to make all sorts of scenarioes that scares me and just makes me want to have her in front of me and tell me she still loves me.\nMy depression and anxiety is growing worse, but I'm also afraid that if I keep communicating that to her, she'll grow annoyed and not want to spend time with me.\nI also have an appointment lined up with my doctor, as that might allow me to get financial aid with some therapy, but that is two weeks off and I feel as if I might crack any moment. I really don't know what to do and just need somewhere to vent. I've begun having these thoughts whether I'd just be saving us both a lot of pain by just running off and cutting ties to everything and starting over somewhere.. It's as if no matter what solution I'm thinking of there's no light at the end of the tunnel and I just have this fear that no matter how hard I try it's going to go wrong and she'll end up growing tired with the hardship anyway and end it..\nEverything just feels overwhelming",

It's been 3 fucking years and it stills hurst me how bad we did, she was a wonderful person and I managed to fuck it all up.\nI really feel like I'd die if someone didn't tell me to sleep or eat. Not like I care though.\nI'm tired of this. Everytime I start getting friends they end up leaving me because i fuck something up.

God I really wish I had someone to hug but instead my pillow has to replace that \"someone\" that I doubt will ever come.\nAnd for fuck's sake.

I tried to quit porn many times but it's hard because it's an addiction, It became even harder when I had to deal with narcissistic abuse that, alongside porn and other stuff, led me to depression. So now depression eats me alive and addiction became a coping mechanism and I've been stuck in that cycle for a while now.\nI keep going back and forth between believing that my life is 100% my responsibility and believing that I was happy before I got abused so abuse takes the most blame for my situation. The addiction started before the abuse but I wasn't depressed yet. That addiction became 4x worse after the abuse.\nSo, is it 100% my fault ? Am I waking up everyday with the intention of making myself sad ? Does the \"happiness is a choice\" mindset apply to that situation ? Because if so then i don't get to complain right ?",

I wish I could leave them and go to the farthest place in the world and never come back, and never talk to them again.",

 "text": "Did your meds (antidepressants) actually work the way they are supposed to? If you just felt like a vegetable, with little emotion, while on them, you were on the wrong meds. Mine were only working so-so. I changed to what some in the mental health field call California rocket fuel, and it made all the difference. It's a two-med combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine and has become popular as a first-line treatment with some MH professionals, and it is often used for treatment-resistant depression. \nI also went through TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation--nothing like electroconvulsive therapy) sessions, which improved things somewhat. My anxiety and depression scores were significantly improved over the course of TMS treatments. I can recommend them, based on my personal experience, but they don't improve things for everyone, though they have zero side effects, which is more than can be said for meds. TMS is covered by most insurance, I'm told, and Medicare covers it. \nThere is also talk therapy, which is highly recommended to go along with pharmaceutical treatments. \nIf you've tried all of the above, there are still other avenues to try.\nBack to antidepressants. Besides the TCAs, SSRIs, and SNRIs, there are at least a couple of tetracyclic types, and then there is the MAOIs. The latter usually do work, but require some dietary restrictions to avoid serious side effects. \nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-major-classes-of-antidepressants-1065086\nOf course, you are familar with feeling the sadness of depression, and we tend to go back to what we're familiar with, so I think I understand where you're coming from. But if you want to feel anything like normal (not like you're \"drugged\"), there are more things you can do.",

If that's keeping you from being with your friends or from making friends, it might help. \nFor some reason, we tend to isolate ourselves when we feel bad, just when we really need to be with friends. \nI do believe you can eventually not have to just endure life, and you'll find you enjoy life more instead. Not that you won't have sad periods, like when a loved one dies, you lose your job, etc., but that is a different kind of sadness that lightens up over time.",

I felt lost and like everything in my life was far away and no longer felt \u201cright\u201d. - I don\u2019t do well in the winter so combine seasonal depression with feeling lost in life in my late twenties, and trying to make life big changes but not knowing how or what to do\u2026 I\u2019ve been struggling. \nI was on Effexor for 4 years and despite feeling half numb and no sex drive it saved my life initially.

The worst part is I know the tools to get through this but they aren\u2019t helping or making me feel less alone. \nMy doc keeps telling me to be patient with the lamictal but I\u2019m just desperate for relief.

It sounds like you've been struggling for a while now, and the winter months have only made things more difficult for you. I can totally understand how you feel, as winter can be a tough season for a lot of people.\nI'm glad to hear that you're seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, and that you're trying different medications to find something that works for you. It can be really frustrating when it takes a while for medications to start working, but it's important to remember that everyone's journey is different, and recovery is not always linear.\nHave you tried any other forms of treatment or self-care that might help you feel better? Sometimes, exercise, being outside in the sun, or practicing mindfulness can all help with managing depression. It might be worth exploring some other options and seeing if they work for you.\nI know it can feel really lonely when you're struggling with depression, but please know that you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep reaching out for help, and remember that things will get better with time.",

 "text": "A few days ago I literally saved someone from killing themselves! So for context I work for the NHS CAMHS (child and adolescent mental heath services) so technically it's my jobs and this isn't the first time I've technically saved but anyway. Point is was on escorted leave middle of town and they attempted to run into traffic, the result me and my colleague had to restrain them in the middle of town on a concrete path. Not ideal I know however safer then letting them run into traffic. Police came and helpted us return to the ward. \nSounds like a great thing preventing it but I cannot stop thinking about how terrified and potentially traumatised the witness's were, literally people that most likely havbt ever seen anything like that. I feel guilty that it even got that far, how did the nurses not see the risk before allowing leave  why were we not told about the risk, what could we have done differently. \nI'm struggling so much with the guilt of having thoes people see that. With the guilt of it getting that far (even tho wasn't my choice or decision). I look at the scrapes, bruises and cuts I have from the concrete. The bruises on my jaw amd chest from their kicks and punches and I can't not see how horrific it was for thoes people to witness. Just sucks how somthing that should be good can really get to your own mental health and can impact you. But I guess that's just part of the job. \nPeople are always shitting on CAHMS in the UK and don't get me wrong it needs a massive improvement but the support workers, thoes trying their upmost to change the lives of these kids, no one really knows the stuff we see or have to go through. \nI would like to say we did prevent them from injury, they are safe on the ward.",

(Bless her) The only problem is I was never disciplined or taught any real life skills/healthy habits. I got away with everything and never had to do anything for myself. I'm 30 now and have nothing to show for it. No job, no future prospects and I don't clean my room for MONTHS at a time. With the amount of food ordering we do, my room has become a bit of a hoarding problem...and I know I'm not blameless because I recognize how shit I am to her at times, but at the same time I feel resentful because I feel like it was my gmas job after she took me in to at least try to help fix the bad habits I developed my first 6 years of life. My gma is fucking 80 and I feel like a monster for feeling so hateful towards her...sorry for the wall of text, I desperately needed a vent lol",

Is this really a part of her response to medication? We did a follow-up check-up, and mentioned her suicidal thoughts and increasing anxiety. However, she was advised to just continue with her medication. I would like to know if any, among these, is aggravating her condition and exacerbating suicidal thoughts. Should she continue taking them as advised by her psychiatrist?\nLooking forward to your esteemed opinions. Thank you in advance!",
