    "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

    "text": "I thought I\u2019m cured for my depression. Since 5 years ago I changed my lifestyle. I have better life and I\u2019m being so busy.\nBut this year since going to appointments in dentist week after week, seeing the same people I feel so awkward and just feeling so bad as if I\u2019m some sort of handicapped that people kepts on mocking. \nI don\u2019t like the feeling especially when I\u2019m already having bad life around people, roommates and everyday people I met.\nI hate this feeling that society keep want to push me to be \u201cbetter\u201d with social skills. Why can\u2019t they just understand that I\u2019m just not talkative but they think that being quiet means I\u2019m hiding some knife behind me and about to stab them all. I don\u2019t get it.\nI\u2019m struggling and stressing so much I can\u2019t seem to get any sleep. I\u2019m lacking sleep so much I feel like I\u2019m passing out at job. \nI love what I do and I enjoy it and I needed it the most. I can\u2019t lose a job.\nI used to think it\u2019ll be the easiest to finally leave when I was fired from my job because then nobody will need to see me or wonder where I\u2019d been. \nBut now that I feel like I might lost my job, I\u2019m thinking something different again to survive.\nI\u2019m so scared sometimes but sometimes I just wish there\u2019s just way for me to be happy.\nI think someone I love is taking anti anxiety or depression pills because they seem to be very happy and really really normal.\nBut to me, I\u2019ll never be normal, I was given this life to live, I didn\u2019t have friends. \nI had that one friend in high school who was trying hard to make me feel better but I lost her because I\u2019m just such a cry baby, I acted too immature for her and she\u2019s a senior and I\u2019m just a freshman, she could have been the exact person I wanted to be friends with now, but I no longer find someone like her.\nAnyways I\u2019m rambling and I need to rest my stupid head or it\u2019ll explode.\nI don\u2019t know anymore. I\u2019m overthinking. I think I dread 2023 will be very bad for me",

They tell me that I shouldn\u2019t make excuses but that does not apply to them. They get to live a happy life and I don\u2019t because I\u2019m horrible and I deserve eternal suffering. \nThey will always lie. Always. They think I\u2019m a nightmare and they think I\u2019m disgusting. They lie to your face and be nice but behind your back they will destroy you. And it\u2019s funny to them.",

    "text": "So many people in my life going through something. Somethings of varying degrees, but all equally important. Made me realize people need someone to listen to them. I try my best to be that for everyone that comes to me looking to talk, but it's hard to balance their problems and try to deal with my own problems all in my head. I care about and worry about everyone in my life, but I can't play therapist when I think about ending my shit every damn day. \nI try my hardest to stay positive and be grateful, but it's hard to not see how messed up the world can be.",

I had to get rid of a painting because he keeps thinking and telling me that it\u2019s influencing my depression. I. Got. It. Because. I. Thought. It. Was. Cool. I keep saying to myself that I should stay away from people because I\u2019m this delusional problematic ungrateful person, I wanted to tell my friends that \u201chey, maybe what my dad says about me is right, you probably shouldn\u2019t be friends with me because I am no good.\u201d Even after I move out of my parents house, my father is still probably going to control my life, cuz I can\u2019t make my own decisions and decide what makes me happy because I have depression and anxiety. I\u2019m too mentally ill to say anything.",
