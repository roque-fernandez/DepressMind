Your just talking with someone trained to make YOU comfortable. So you can open up and once you do that's when they start helping.\nNone of it is invasive and even when they do start helping it is in such a way (in my exp anyways) that they just show you the path that you need to mentally lead yourself down..\nADHD is a constant struggle but therapy helps a shit ton.
