    "text": "MAKE r/Asuka GREAT AGAIN! (also use \"Back to Old Reddit\" First of all, Hit \"Back to Old Reddit\" and if you have RES press \"show images\" to see how I originally envisioned and designed the sub back in 2015!\nI might re-write this post when I actually have some free time, but if you are new to r/Asuka welcome to the sub for (let's be honest here) the best girl!\nI am currently having discussions with my fellow mods on how we can make this sub a better and nicer place for all of us.\nIn 2015 I saw that there was no sub for our queen Asuka and thought that this was a niche that needed to be filled. Unfortunately, after doing some basic design and getting the sub started I did not have much time to actually take care of the sub and maintain it so I relied on my (amazing!) fellow mods who honestly did a great job getting the sub to where it is right now.\nThis sub is not for profit or any kind of gain, but I do want to see people joking, commenting, and having fun.\nWe are having discussions on potentially having contests/ giveaways for best posts, memes and cosplays.\nNow we need your help as well! Please comment, message me, or mail the sub if you have any suggestions/comments/constructive criticism on how we can improve and get more activity and engagement on our sub. Also if you believe you have the skills and know how to make positive changes to the sub or know someone who can message us ASAP.\nI encourage you to post your best art, memes and cosplays! Also make sure to post and cross-post friendly banter (images, memes etc.) to r/ReiAyanami whom this sub is frienemies with :) (you would see this if you use Old reddit were we say that r/ReiAyanami is the yin to our yang! [[Remember to follow both of our subs rules! Keep it friendly and civil!]]\nWe have a zero tolerance policy towards spam (especially shirts)/ advertising / \"loli\" posts.\nThank you for reading this far and I look forward to hearing from everyone who reads this! It's been a tough couple years for most of us I am sure but at least look forward to great things from us.\nu/alik2142 on behalf of all of us at r/Asuka",

    "text": "Serious misuse of the \"Art: Multiple\" flair There is extensive misuse of the \"Art: Multiple\" flair going on, even though it should've been self-explanatory. This flair is intended for use on posts where there is more than one version of Asuka being depicted/cosplayed that would otherwise merit application of two or more of our character flairs; furthermore, you are supposed to edit the flair so that the \"INSERT NAMES\" part is replaced with the names of the Asuka versions that are being depicted/cosplayed (refer to our character flairs for reference).\nPlease keep this in mind from now on.",

But as we can also see her arm gets torn into two parts the same way. Those are simply bandaged up. It might be that the lcl does disintegrate the body and reshape it after coming out of it. But the loss of the eye would remain I think. Where would the need be for sinji for treating her head then. In the rebuild it is visible that she retains vision because of her undergoing a fundamental change in physique. If you don't know watch them first. I would say the lance should have destroyed her eye, but the lcl on its own after that might not be enough, because it would not be a simple wound. Equaly she should have piercing head injuries after but they aren't talked about",
