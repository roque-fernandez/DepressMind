Based on the poll I posted last week, I saw a need to try and establish a new chat for folks to join. \nHere is the link for the new Depression_Help chat!! https://s.reddit.com/c/1ae0wmh1t6t6d\nThe link looks weird, but it should toss you directly into the chat as soon as you click on it, after a few loading screens. If you can't get it to work, please reply on this post saying 'add me' and I will invite all that do so to the chat.",
