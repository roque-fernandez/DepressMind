 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.\nIn addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  \nIf you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers\u2019 problems.",

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I\u2019m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don\u2019t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. \nBut anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk.",

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.\nFor the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.\nNow when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much can't do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.\nWhich is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.\nI don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort.",

It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

So it's appropriate for people to be wary of offers of help that come this way.\nI'm not totally certain if your concern is for people who might want to ask for support in private (which as the post says is always okay although it still carries some risks) or for people who want to offer help in PMs, though...?

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

Even though I dont want to self-diagnoze myself. Life just feels empty and everything is getting too much. I dont really feel any joy anymore, just finishsing tasks and quores, because \"I need to\". Then these weird headaches, like being under water and seeing everything through this fog of whatever this is. But I was wondering, you guys who have or had depression, how tf do you live with that? How do you have any motivation to do daily stuff and keep going? How do you get out of this fog?",

I used to overthink everything, I used to be so severely depressed I did nothing. It's been so long, I don't even feel depressed anymore. I used to turn to philosophy to change my perspective of life and it did, i'm absolutely a better person for it. These days I don't even think much anymore. I stopped smoking weed, i'm drinking less but my mind hasn't returned. There's been multiple stages of my life, i'm still a young man i'm only 25, where i've felt i would never live to see that age. I don't want to be a person anymore, i don't like other people. Still other people love me, everyone i work with and meet have nothing but good things to say. Still everyones perspective come from idealized version they were raised, taught, or told to believe and often times from a lens of their own past experiences. I can't do it anymore. I'm alone in society and always have been, and by myself I am nothing. I'd rather be nothing. I don't want to be a misanthrope, I don't want to be anything but nothing. I don't like being human. I'm exhausted with life. I can't even express myself. I live to just be, I just am. I can't even want anymore. I don't even know what it means to want. I'm blind, deaf, and numb to existence.",

I had friends who I became distant with, my mother is on her own way of processing her divorce with my scumbag dad, so I lost my father first hand the moment he started beating my mom. In my entire life, I listened to music 24/7 cutting out the people I felt awkward, out of place with. I have no lover to comfort me and show me that there is still hope and I have a way to be happy. I struggle to find it on my own, so a little help never hurts. When I celebrated, I had music and a beer with a game of chess on my phone. Music expresses my feelings and whatever I play, it matches my mood or emotions I am facing. I tried hitting a bar, but I was hung over so it didn't feel as good as I thought it would feel. I want to cry out every ounce of tears out of my eye and turn off my brain to be myself. I am a man, I can't cry, I can take anything. I have no emotions so it won't matter how hurt I am. I want to be treated as a human being. I want to be happy too, because I deserve it as much as anyone else. Not more or less, I am equal to my peers and to every single person.

It's important to seek help and talk to someone about how you're feeling, whether it's a friend, family member, or a mental health professional.\nRemember that you are not alone in this, and that you are worthy of love and friendship. Try not to let negative thoughts take over and instead focus on your strengths and the things that make you unique. It's okay to take some time for yourself, but also consider reaching out to your friends and spending time with them. They may be more supportive than you think.\nFinally, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone has their own struggles and insecurities, and it's okay to be imperfect. Be kind to yourself and take small steps towards building your confidence and self-esteem.",

He passed away almost 3 years ago and in the time we have celebrated him more than I have ever been celebrated. Mom and I were watching tv the other day and she remarked that she never had birthday parties growing up. I said neither did I. She disagreed telling me about all these parties until I pointed out that those parties were for my brother and sometimes sister. Then it was the same lecture I got after he died: \u201cit\u2019s not that he was the favorite it\u2019s just that he had a special relationship with my parents that me and my sister could never experience because he saved their marriage/made them parents/he was the only son.\u201d My birthday is usually forgotten because it\u2019s right around Thanksgiving. I had a sweet sixteen that wound up being more of a family party with pink decorations. \nBeing the one never chosen has effected me forever. I was such a pick me it must have been annoying. I was chosen first once in my life:by my husband, the greatest person I know. And I feel like he\u2019s lived to regret that choice. I\u2019ve tried to make life what we wanted but it seems to kick us in the ass at every turn because of me: employment issues for both but especially for me, medical issues on my side, two miscarriages in the last 2 years, living with our families the last 8 years of our 11 year marriage. And he\u2019s broken I think. \nNow he\u2019s going back to drinking and watching porn/playing pornographic video games constantly lying about it to me. I beg for his touch and attention but who would want a middle aged fat useless barren wife to look forward to coming home to?",

Since i was a kid i'm struggling with episodes of depression and anxiety, now, i am at the point when i just don't know what to do anymore. Somedays i just feel good and i say to myself \"yeah ok everything's gonna be alright you can make it\" and then, the day after it or even the same evening i just feel like i'm not able to do anything, i just lay in the bed and let the time go away. Also i'm having some problems with staying sober. Everyday after school, if i don't have weed to smoke i drink alcohol, if there is no alcohol i smoke weed, no matter what i just can't stay sober. And if i have to, i'm just angry all the time and avoid anyone, i just lay in the bed. I have hobbies and interests, even a dream work (psychiatrist lol), but i don't have the motivation to pursue them, so i'm always \"the same\". Hope someday i'll figure out how to make it all work.\nThank you.",

It's definitely something to look into while you're a student.\nRegardless, I really hope you feel better soon. If possible, pick up one thing that you can do that could help you feel better. Whether it's a pre-existing hobby or a new one, having something to do can help take your mind off of things and provide you with a source of joy, even if it's just for a little while. It may not solve your problems, but such a thing can help provide a little bit of relief.\nTreasure your mom and dad and spend time with them if you can. Whenever you feel ready, try to find friends in your area / college that can also provide you joy and support. Don't rush into socialization, especially since you aren't feeling well right now. \nTry to take it easy and just do what you need to do to survive. It's okay. You'll thank yourself for it later. Take small steps towards improving your mental health and your situation; change doesn't need to be immediate for it to be powerful and long-lasting.\nPlease don't give up. Take it slow and steady.

Unfortunately our emotions don't know what can be changed and what can't.\nIf you can't change it, you must accept it and use it to your advantage, not let it cause you a disadvantage.\nIt might be just what you need!

I try not to show how much I rely on them and just carry on a day-to-day conversation which helps me so I don't need to pressure others and be a burden. However, it really fucking sucks when that person disappears in your life because I am just totally wracked from the inside going back to drinking sleeping my day away.",

When I experience this I get doubly depressed and deflated from the fact that I rely on the person so much, and end up really conflicted as to whether I want to lean on them or not. It feels like I can\u2019t win.\nI think it\u2019s okay to rely on people when we need them. Sometimes I think maybe in general we\u2019re not encouraged to rely on people enough.\nIs it a fear / frustration at a lack of autonomy? A fear of driving the other person away?",

I have had small/minor bouts, but never anything this long term. I am typically a happy go lucky, outgoing, social person. Right now I feel so unlike myself. This depression had caused me to push important people in my life away. I\u2019ve said things I don\u2019t mean and I don\u2019t even know why. Why do we do these things when we are feeling this way? Why push people away when you need them most? I said things that are so hurtful. I can\u2019t take them back. Now the one person I had to lean on is gone.. because of the stupid stuff my mouth spewed when I was upset. I never want to hurt anyone. Especially when it some one I love. Dealing with a depression on top of a heartache feels so heavy, and I know it\u2019s my own fault. My hopes to anyone going through something similar, is to try and open up to the people who care. Do be stubborn and push them away. You don\u2019t want to lose them.",

There's no guarantee other style would work better.\n\u200b\nI don't know why people romanticized adoption nowadays, be it human or pet. It sounds noble but not without trouble.

I have had treatment resistant MDD for 10ish years, and the main symptom that is currently hurting my daily function is extreme fatigue, regardless of how much sleep I get. I\u2019ve done all the things you do before talking medication, most of them multiple times, so please no suggestions of sleep studies or light therapy or resetting my circadian rhythm. I\u2019m planning to talk to my psych about possible medications to help\u2014 I was thinking stimulants, as that seems to be common treatment for CFS, but I\u2019m not a doctor, I\u2019m open to anything. I\u2019m also on Pristiq and Wellbutrin and do weekly CBT. Does anyone have suggestions of medications to look into? Especially if you\u2019ve been on them and had success with them?

I thought I was getting better to be honest. Maybe I was, maybe I did get better but no matter what I do I always end up here. I get better but everytime I do I get worse as well. It's like im rising and the more I rise the harder I plummet. I'm so sick and tired of this. I really do want to give up, I cant take it anymore but I dont wanna leave my boyfriend. I wanna have a future with him, but I cant do this anymore.  I dont even know what to do in the future. I dont know what to do in the future, im going to college next year and I dont even know what course to take. I want to give my boyfriend everything in the future but I don't know how to, because I dont even know what career to do in the future. I dont have anything that im actually passionate about. I don't have anything that drives me. My boyfriend and my dog are the only reason I'm still here. This week I feel like my world revolves around my boyfriend. It's probably because im unconsciously clinging to my last reason to live. Im unconsciously making him my everything because I know that if I dont, I might actually do it. I ran out of motivation and reasons to live. He is the last reason and I'm clinging to it. Why cant I get better? I've been wanting to end it since I was 10 or 11 and now I'm 17 and im still suffering. Im still stagnant. I cant do this anymore. I promised him that I wont hurt myself, but I did 5 days ago and I did it again 20 minutes ago. I'm such a bad girlfriend, I feel like I'm draining him out because I keep telling him all my problems. I'm not doing well at school, I have been numb for days and then I was trying to study Math and it triggered me. I just started to breakdown because I cant understand it. How am I supposed to have a nice future If I cant even understand math. I'm not doing well with my family either nor with friends. My family keeps comparing me to my greatest friend and it's bs. My family isn't content with my scores nor with anything with me. I'm trying my best to get out of bed yet my family is here complaining about how I didn't get a perfect score or something. My family knows that my grandpa has been harassing me for years yet they turn a blind eye to it. My family emotionally abuses me and I cant take it. I want to stop caring about everyone's feelings but I cant leave my boyfriend. I really dont want to leave him. I'm trying hard to keep holding on but I just cant.",

 "text": "Autophobia is scary I wanted to reflect after reading another post that I feel summarizes depression quite well.\nWhat is it like to undergo depression? How does it feel? How does one deal with it? How important is it to be patient when dealing with depression?\nDepression affects everyone differently. Sometimes it's been inside the whole time, waiting to strike at the right moment. Other times it's something that will never really go away because of things beyond our control. This is my summary of how I've been feeling over the last couple months after 10+ years of hurt.\n\nI wasn't always like this. I used to dream of using technology to improve the world. Used to spend hours beat mixing albums and organizing / editing photos. Used to see value in working for a pittance. Used to be independent. Some people even say I used to smile in photographs. Not anymore. None of that matters when life feels like it's not progressing at all. What do you do when everything feels pointless?\nThe only thing keeping me going is a close group of friends who do stuff on weekends. Nothing else matters more than having people who will support my struggles, who I'd do the same for in return. The thought or actuality of losing those friends scares the crap out of me. I know the only constant in life is change, but Autophobia is real and hurts so much.\nNow, living at home isn't so bad; rent is cheap, we have family meals, and people are around. However, I can't help but feel like doing the same thing with the same people in the same house for 3+ decades is part of the problem. Our worldly socio-economic policies don't help either, but I know I can't change those so I'm trying not to focus on them too much.\nPart of me wants to move out, both to grow and live life to its fullest. However, I'm also deathly afraid of moving out without someone who will help keep my mind grounded, remind me to function, and be there when (not if) I have another mental breakdown. It's not my friends responsibility to watch over me, but I need friends around to help qualm my Autophobia.\nAll we can do is learn to cope with each passing day. I'm still at home, learning to cope as best I can, all while trying to find the motivation to move forward with life, whatever that looks like. I hope you can find peace in your life too, because we all deserve to live a fulfilling life with as little complications as necessary.",

 "text": "Hey friend, I've had this same thought many times. Basically sums up to \"what's the point?\", right? And that is exasperating to try to answer. What I've personally found, when my depression lifts, I can see a point. I can see beauty and joy and hope and love in the small moments of life and I think \"well damn, it is worth it. Look at that beautiful smile on my son's face. Listen to that song, I can feel that in my soul. Wow, that is such a breathtaking view. My God, this pizza is to die for. Etc. And I mean it in those moments. But then depression settles back in and I literally can't remember what it felt like that made me enjoy those things so much that it makes the rest of the mundane shit seem worth it. And that makes me spiral. And I fight against myself and somehow I make it through. And my depression lifts and I can feel again. The cycle repeats. Eventually I've come to realize that when I'm depressed I've lost the ability to remember or feel that anymore so yeah its hard to rationalize and fight. It's like I've been submerged into a walking dream and I need to wake up to feel again. But every time I do. Even if it's just for a short time, I come back. Always with a struggle but I come back. I know it's hard to remember those moments when you're in the pit, the depression truly blocks your ability to feel it and remember, but just try to hold on through this season to get to the next good one. When you do get there, journal the hell out of every emotion. Or create art if that's something you do. Or make a video. But capture the essence of what you're feeling so that when you can't remember next time, you know why you're still fighting. The more I did this, the easier it was to fight through and bounce back. It's taken a lot of time, but I'm currently in my longest stretch of not wanting die after thinking this way for over 15 years. Stay strong my friend, try ti get to that next good season and jeep something around to remind yourself how good it feels to be alive, even when life is mundane. Give yourself something to fight for.",

I can always choose to die another day. \nAfter 9 years, I haven\u2019t regretted that I postponed this decision yet.",
