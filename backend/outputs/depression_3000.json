 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker.

Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that; \nI fell into the \u201cI want to feel helpful\u201d category despite my best intentions.\nI did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn\u2019t help me and I couldn\u2019t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better. \nAfter that I never replied regarding dm\u2019s and kept it to comment chains only.\nThank you for doing this and thank you for your work, this is a safe place which sometimes might need protecting from itself. After all, in the haze of my own misery and thoughts I never properly read the rules and just.. reached out.",

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I\u2019m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don\u2019t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. \nBut anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk.",

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.\nFor the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.\nNow when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much can't do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.\nWhich is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.\nI don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort.",

It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

So it's appropriate for people to be wary of offers of help that come this way.\nI'm not totally certain if your concern is for people who might want to ask for support in private (which as the post says is always okay although it still carries some risks) or for people who want to offer help in PMs, though...?

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

Now I am just focused on trying to get out of that survival mode mindset because i don't need it anymore and as anything that doesn't serve a purpose for me I try to remove it.\nTrying to make friends, meet a partner and build a life that I can be proud of is hard work but for me it's just necessity now!",

My weight, my looks, the fact I am ignorant to many things. It's something that rarely bothers me. I've came to terms with it after all these years. Plus it's a weird coping mechanism I guess.\nI was talking to a friend of mine in the break room when a co-worker walks in and tells her that she looks beautiful. I go in to make a self deprecating joke like \"hey aren't I beautiful too?\"  The look she gave me and the hesitation to say anything sure left an impression. Funnily enough if she said \"not really\" I could've easily played off that. But to say nothing impacted me more than anything. It's been a few months since anything has put me down easily. I haven't been overthinking and getting into my head as easily. I haven't cut myself since January. But damn. That kinda hit deep. To be fair I was asking for it I suppose.

There are usually services and/or programs that people facing homelessness and other serious hardships can access. It wont be immediate, but the people working at these resources and programs should be able to help set you up atleast with a framework or plan of what you can do next to get things back on track. If you cant find anything immediately, dont give up. Keep searching. Unless you live in the sticks, most cities have something in place Ask LOTS of questions, programs or services to help with paying for any medications, food stamps, or anything. Take advantage of any program/service you qualify for that can help you. And avoid instant cash loans. They are basically debt traps and will fuck you with extremely high intrest rates. You may also want to look into applying for unemployment. Dont give up hope! I hope this was at least a little helpful!!",

I start to tear up but my mind and body shuts down all my emotions and I can't cry. I want to cry so bad, to just let it out and feel something real again, but I just grow numb immediately. I feel the build up, my eyes start stinging and then out of nowhere, nothing. I feel nothing. I physically can't cry anymore. Last time I felt like I was having a break down I just started to laugh hysterically and just had this huge grin on my face until I grew numb again. I don't know what's wrong with me. Am I the only one ?\nI lost track of time, a whole year has passed in the blink of an eye and nothing has changed. All the suicide jokes I made to myself have slowly developed into real dark urges. \nI can't kill myself and leave my friends and family to pick up the pieces. So I'm forced to be hopeful though. I was happy 3 years before grief struck, I know I can be happy again. I'm a suicidal optimist, which is extremely goofy.",

Especially with the pressure you are facing it seems reasonable for your brain to be a bit drained. \nAlso Try to self reflect upon the aspects that build the circumstances you are facing right now. Since depression often is so overwhelming were forced to see everything Grey scaled and drawing connections between moods and mental illness becomes alot harder. For example what exactly is bothering you about your job? Is it something about the job itself (Form of Labor, Customer Comment ect.) or something mental illness related (A situation accured that triggered your mental illness).",

When i was in hs i used to self harm, and when my mom found out i stopped out of embarrassment. i've relapsed once or twice, but recently i've had this crippling feeling of lonliness and sadness. I can hardly get out of bed to use the washroom or eat, even when i do get out of bed things like eating just aren't important to me or just feels like too much work. I can't do my school work, my body and braid just won't allow it, and this causes more sadness because of the anxiety of failing school and being worthless. Life just feels very heavy and i hate who i am, i don't feel like i have a future. I have no goals or real accomplishments and the friends that i have i just don't think are my people, i feel like i don't have anyone. I've never been able to talk to anyone about this because first of all i don't think anyone really hears or listens to me, and second its embarrassing. I hate the feeling of people feeling bad for me, so i suffer in silence. I've done this my whole life.

I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend and the guys I have tried to date end up being sleazy. I just want to be a homemaker and this college life isn\u2019t for me.

I haven\u2019t met the one, if I go home and quit school then I\u2019m just doing nothing\u2026 I just feel so stuck and lost in life. \nOn top of that I don\u2019t do any of my hobbies anymore. I live out of state and my mom refuses to help drive my things over so I can only brings stuff by airplane. I don\u2019t play piano anymore, I don\u2019t cook or bake which are things that make me really happy. \nI know someone is going to call me lazy but I swear that isn\u2019t the case.

When I look at myself I see that I, don't have a job, horrible in public settings and pretty much spend most the time I talk to him feeling envious of him. I'm a loser who doesn't really have a life to look forward too. I can tell my friend has developed over the past 3 years as well. We are both 21 but it feels very obvious that he has a more adult life. The way he talks to people is normal and he can start conversations with others well. While with me it's kinda just me being an awkward loser who tries to be funny. So my question to you all is. Should I just start slowly ghosting him so he can get me out of his life. I feel like I'm only holding him backhes made it clear that he hates people like me (not me specificall but how he described it, was basically like me) he's my only friend and I know ill be pretty lonely but should I?

 "text": "I'm not in a good headspace. Life in general. I've been through so much bullshit people don't even believe me anymore. My father abused my mom, and when she ran away, he started beating me. I told the schools when I was six, and they just turned around and told my dad everything I said. He told them I have a vivid imagination, and then proceeded to chuck me off of the roof of our house when, keep in mind, I was six years old. He hit me in the head with a metal bat when I was nine, shot me with a BB gun, tried to stab me, hit me in the head with beer bottles, and coming home from school to see him slouched over with a bottle of pills in his hand thinking he was dead wasn't fun either.\nUltimately became homeless at 12 and worked at a McDonald's on night shift when I did school during the day from 12-18, then stayed at McDonald's until the beginning of 2020 when I finally got a tax job. I could never go to homeless shelters because if the cops find you, they just drop you off at that the border of another state (I won't say which ones). I've seen it to many people I knew during my time on the street.\nNow I'm finally away from the worst parts of my life, but the trauma is even worse. I can't sleep. I can barely breathe. I have heart problems and I'm sure I'm just one bad day away from going into a mental breakdown. I've seen murders, assaults, mutilations and everything else. It's shown me the worst parts of humanities and also that the good parts are extremely few and far in between.\nNow that I'm relatively stable, about to both work and do college full-time, I wanted to give humanity another chance to prove me wrong, but I think it's finally pushed me to my breaking point. Europe is having the most deadly war since WWII and everybody's looking at it from a numbers and patriotism standpoint instead of a humanity standpoint. I seriously don't think I can do this much longer.\nUpdate: My grandfather passed away two nights ago after being in the hospital for three weeks. My uncle called and told me that he went in for a mild case of pneumonia. Two weeks after he's admitted, my uncle calls me and tells me out of nowhere that my grandpa's lungs and kidneys both have failed and that he's refusing dialysis. Now that he's passed, I found out that they've set his funeral on a day that I can't be there because my job only has two employees - me and my boss, and my boss is going to be halfway across the country, so there's literally no way I can go to it. I really needed some form of closure, because thanks to being in legal trouble with my dad, we had a restraining order, and he went to my grandmother's viewing and funeral, which meant I couldn't be there. Now I can't be there for my grandfather because nobody consulted me when they were planning the date of his stuff.\nThe slip and slidal moments are back. They've been gone for about a year or so, but they started again some time in late January. I've always resolved that I would only take my own life if I had a handgun capable of instant death (a .9mm or higher), but last night, I impulsive straight up got out of bed and went to find the knife in my utensil drawer (I only have one knife that isn't a butter knife), and it wasn't there, so after I spent five minutes or so looking for it, I finally came back to reality and spent the entire night sobbing my eyes out.\nIt's too much. I'll leave nothing behind when I pass and I'm completely okay with that. Nobody would even know what happened, because I've told them that I've been considering moving either to Wyoming or Germany, so if I just stopped being responsive they'll assume that I've moved and stopped ghosting everybody. I have the perfect plan to end everything in a place where nobody will find my body, so nobody would be traumatized by seeing a corpse out somewhere, but so far I've been able to resist. I don't know why. I don't want to be here. I don't want things to get better anymore, I just want to be gone.\nIt's just.. getting to be too much.",

This whole existence has no purpose or meaning.  You\u2019re born without your consent, then you experience trauma in early childhood that pretty much ruins any chance of having a happy/healthy life, then you get a job that pays you poorly and treats you like shit, then you find another human to procreate with, you bring another human in this world to go through the same bullshit you\u2019re going through and the cycle continues.  Trauma and addiction gets passed from generation to generation.  There is no greater good on planet earth.  I hate it here and just want it to be over. Life is something to get over with like a shift at work.",

This is a common occurrence for me when I\u2019m having   anxiety/depression  episodes. I just feel empty. I want a girlfriend more than anything in the world. As a 21 year old that\u2019s not a very common thing to want, but it\u2019s all I want. The apps don\u2019t work for me, no one swipes right which even I\u2019m kind of surprised by because I know I\u2019m not the worst looking person. It shoots me down hard and makes me feel like nothing. But when I talk to girls in real life they seem to enjoy talking to me as much as I enjoy talking to them. I\u2019ve gotten a few numbers from people in my classes and at the bar, but they haven\u2019t gone anywhere (yet). Idk the emptiness is starting to let in a cool breeze that I feel could turn me cold. The worst part is nobody put that hole there. It\u2019s just so heavy with love to give that it\u2019s turning it into hatred to take.",

I work at 3pm so for the past few months I\u2019ve literally been laying in bed for 12 hours. I work at a gym so working out helps me a lot, but as soon as I\u2019m home I would just feel like a lazy sack of meat and a failure. My friends are graduating and getting big boy jobs and I\u2019m just stuck. But recently I have started digging myself out of the hole. You have to realize what you\u2019re doing. The time that you should be using to better yourself and chase your dreams, you\u2019re using it instead to stress about what your family thinks and what the people around you are doing. Usually when you don\u2019t have any interest in school, you\u2019re a business man/ entrepreneur. I started a ATM business a few months ago and it\u2019s been great. It keeps me occupied when I\u2019m not at work, and the money motivates me to achieve financial freedom. All our friends who are in school are going to be 9-5 slaves until they\u2019re 65 and we don\u2019t want that life for ourselves, hence why we can\u2019t stay in a classroom lol. When you\u2019re successful and financially stable your family will realize you never needed a degree. Start taking risks and chances bc you\u2019re young. If you absolutely fucked up today, two years from now you\u2019ll be 25 and still young. Keep your head up and find your grind, a textbooks will not teach you how to live life!",

I thought I was really doing better but guess not. Nothing gets better, people say it gets better maybe it does for a while but that\u2019ll go away. When can I stop feeling shit and stop overthinking about everything. I\u2019ve been failing school since the beginning of 10th grade this year, I don\u2019t have many friends and lost tons of friends in person because of how much I\u2019ve distance myself away from them because of my mental health and people at my school seems really nice but I\u2019m scared of being backstabbed. I\u2019ve tried everything to make myself get a better aspect of life or find things to change my view but nothing has worked. I hate it here so much. I dislike school because i feel different from everyone because I don\u2019t know how to do basic algebra or trigonometry regardless of how many times I\u2019ve tried studying it even after school hours, I hate having an learning disability and slow understanding. I\u2019m ugly truly, I\u2019ve been skipping school unexcused so many times and I\u2019m a online a student. How can a online student possibly fail online schooling? I\u2019m not even sure myself but I know that I\u2019m not even motivated just fucking myself over with these ruthless suicidal thoughts in my head and slowly giving up and just wanna end my life sooner. I\u2019m so sick and disgusted for even feeling this way because I know many kids/teenagers out there who want the privilege being accessed to free education,etc and they are probably going through way more than me.I just wanna get out of my body and be free. I love my family and gf/friends; they treat me well but I can\u2019t anymore going on. I\u2019m sorry whoever is reading this I was you well I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore.. i can\u2019t keep gaming as my therapy and to escape reality 24/7. My mind is feeding me up so much and I wanna visit my hamster and grandpa up there when I pass. Have a goodnight/goodmorning or good afternoon where ever you are.",

I wish I was put on an antidepressant back when I could've made better choices and a life for myself. At least give yourself a fighting chance at life instead of fighting yourself for life!",

Your weight or looks are not your personality. When focusing excklusively on that, people will never get to know you. If you want it to change, you need to change it. Self pity is not helping. Attractive is not the person who lost a lot of weight, but the person who is able to identify a problem, reflect on it and then act on it.",

I was *TW* sexually abusedand mentally abused by older friends starting from that age and since then I have never felt truly happy. I was bullied in school or overlooked as I was never physically or conventionally attractive. I went through an eating disorder. I watched one of my friends spiral into suicide. My ex drank herself to death for years while I just sat idly by, I was bullied by my family for my bisexuality, my best friend throughout middle and high school did her best to constantly replace me.\nDespite all of this, I really tried. I got straight A's in high school and managed to graduate with a 4.2, having club participation, and what I thought was a decent friend group. Then college hit and shit hit the fucking fan. I lost all of my friends during COVID because I closed myself off. I made an online friend group that I was basically the older sibling to and lost them from my own stupidity. I barely scraped by with Bs and a few As in my college courses.\nIn 2021, my mental health spiraled so bad my ex cheated on me despite loving me dearly and vice versa. After that occurred, my life just went downhill. I mulled over them for months while I closed myself off from friends. I fought with a friend and ultimately ended a toxic friendship. Things came to a head as my ex popped in and out of my life, until we finally parted in good terms a month before they found a new girlfriend. That same month, 4 friendships of 3+ years ended, I lost my grandmother (first death in the family since i was 12), and a month after, I lost my great aunt (who was my second grandma). Now I have very little friends and the few I have spend their days worrying for me. Ontop of that, I had to quit therapy due to not having money to pay for treatment, leaving my depression, anxiety, and potentially bipolar disorder left unchecked. Oh, and I think I'm falling in love with my best friend I can never have and failing my first semester of junior year of college.\nI fuck everything up. I blame myself for all of this and I can't take it anymore. I am losing my mind to the point of posting to this Reddit for who knows what. This probably doesn't even make sense because I just spilled everything out, and that isn't even the whole of it, just some. I don't know what to do anymore and even if this gets deleted, maybe one person will read it and have some sort of hope for me, because I do not.",

When, I have time alone, I pleasure myself to porn. But, nothing works. At the end of the day, the depression creeps back in. Going to or, talking to a therapist or psychiatrist doesn't help either. I saw a few shrinks years back & all they did was give me medication or, told me to find distractions. Total bullshit. The distractions aren't the ones I want & the meds make my hard on go bye bye.

They came back but I believe that stronger. Since 2021 my life has been like in uncertainity. In my house things with my mom have been weird and she has her own stuff going on. I do care for my family but sometimes i like to think about myself and ending this stuff.\nMy idea of talking over here is to see if I could talk to someone. People! I don't have the possibility of paying a psychologist. I have been attended by a psychiatrist and I believe the pills they prescripted are not functioning thus my next appointment is on august 2023. IDK if you know but psycologist and psychatrist are different stuff so I don't really have help from them. Many people got spiritual help but I feel so so bad that I don't wanna move from bed. If I move, it's because my mom or grandma needs me for anything; besides that, I don't want to do anything.\nMy mom has her own situation with suicide plus anorexia and she has been going through some stuff from work. If I talk to her I know that I will do anything but help her. I don't want to say anything to my best friend. I study at the University but I have done nothing the past 8 weeks I believe, many would think within my social circle that I am exaggerating or just being a total vagabond.\nI don't want to bother my mom with my stuff, I shall be affecting her much more than what she is currently going through. My dad is not even part of this equation, I have his contact and I talked to him maybe an hour ago and he does not care at all. What scares me the most is that in my house there is some medication without usage that if I lose my conscious mind, would drink and lead to a sleepy death with an overdose.\nMy best friend lives far away from me and I saw her more than a month ago. I love her so much because maybe she is the only one I could talk about. But she can barely do anything for me. Much of our friendship, since we graduated in 2021 has become virtual. Besides that I got no friends to talk, I am crying right now. My grandma has cirrhosis which is a sickness that has no cure and I know that she'll die maybe sooner and I don't want that.\nI can't go to church because I feel so lazy that I can barely do anything. I saw about manifestation and started practicing it but I got sort of disappointed idk. I must be by now tidying up and cleaning my room because when I pass away I want everything to be clean but I am lazy to do so. I had so much plans but i feel very bad, broke, and without hope. Now I don't even know if God exists",

A lot of people are alone in college (despite what the media would have us believe about college being the best years of your life). But you might want to look at your interactions with people you tried to become friends with to see if you notice any patterns. Were you just trying with the wrong people (people who wouldn't be a good fit for friendship or weren't looking for new friends)? Did you come on too strong/expect a good friendship to form too quickly (that's my problem often)? \nKeep going to some of those clubs, though. Even if you don't make good friends out of it, it'll give you something to do and a sense of purpose. I worked for the student radio station in undergrad, and even though it only resulted in a couple of very loose friendships, it was still nice to see people when I went to the studio.",

 "text": "I hate being alive You have to be grateful for things and work hard. You have to make smart decisions to survive. You have to work and you have to give a shit about the people that are around you. You have to force yourself to try to have fun. Having fun is a chore and so is being alive. I don't know how much longer I am going to have to deal with having a family to call and having people from my past that I should probably talk to or reconnect with but I just don't want to put forth the effort. I don't want to be emotionally attached to other people in any way and I get no pleasure from them. I'm tired of having to buy shit to survive and I'm tired of having to pretend to be happy to be studying something or getting into a field that makes more money, because at the end of the day I don't really give a shit about where I am in life in the next five, ten, twenty years. I don't care about owning a home or getting a pet and I don't care about doing anything or accomplishing anything. They say you only live once but I just don't give a shit. When you die everything just goes black and so everything that you experience in this life is ultimately completely meaningless anyways. There's nothing to gain from life whatsoever.\nThere is no real reward for living life and there is no way to enjoy it. You have to force yourself to enjoy it and that's too much work. What is the point in caring about anything? I only care about things for superficial reasons and the more I live on my own in this adult life the more I really think I would rather be dead than worry at tall about doing what I have to do in order to take care of myself and survive. I just don't give a shit but I have to in order to avoid suffering. I have to give a shit about brushing my teeth in order to not experience chronic tooth pain, etc. It applies to everything. There is no point to anything and there is no point in trying to help other people because no matter what there will always be someone else in this world who can also help others in a similar way to caring about that is pointless. I would rather isolate myself from everyone else as much as possible because giving a fuck about other people is too heavy. I would rather not be involved in other people's lives because giving a shit about other people is too heavy of a thing and I don't want there to be any weight in my life. Because if you die than everything you lived for is gone forever and you enter the eternal void of darkness, so why bother getting involved with other people in the first place. \nI just don't give a shit about anything man. It's not worth giving a shit about anything. Having interests and being a novice about anything is just humiliating as it is and I don't know. All of this shit is completely pointless and there's really nothing interesting at all about what happens in the world or living life every day. I mean what is the point? I don't give a shit about love. I don't give a shit about sex. I don't feel a thing when I see an attractive woman. That doesn't give me any pleasure. I don't feel a thing when I accomplish a task. That doesn't give me pleasure. I don't want to talk to my family or my \"friends\" who don't really want to talk to me either because I don't feel positive emotions towards other people and I avoid all feelings of love for anything and that includes people. There's not reason to do anything really. \nLiterally every little thing about life is a burden and you are expected to pretend to be happy and caring. Well I don't care and that's not really my choice either. Nothing in this world or in life in general is worth caring about and everything you have to do in life is always a burden, something that sucks out all of your energy. And even getting that energy by going to sleep is also a burden. Having to manage your time and go to sleep at an appropriate time so that you both get enough of it and so that you are well rested by the time you need to be for whatever you have to do the next day is just another example of a burden.\nLife is all about existence getting worse and worse as time goes on. Every additional responsibility you acquire makes life worse. And that's all life is, is acquiring more and more responsibilities. Why bother with any of it really? What is the point in giving a shit besides the avoidance of suffering? This is why I don't have any empathy for people who suffer in this world. It's usually your own choices that lead to that suffering and I've suffered a fair amount due to my own bad choices. So if I end up homeless and starving sure that sucks but I will man up and do something about it. I don't really give a shit about anyone who doesn't have food because they spent their money on more expensive shit that they wanted to eat rather than on bare necessities that would provide them with enough nutrition to get through the day. I don't know. But that's all life is, is shit getting worse. You lose your hair, you need to work harder to make more money, or you need to learn about stuff to make money in a smarter way, which is further burdensome in and of itself. There's nothing to be proud of in this world either. There is nothing I could do that I could look at potentially and think to myself wow, I am proud of myself. No, I'll never feel pride for anything because non of it matters. If you accomplish a positive thing the only thing that actually matters is if you avoided suffering because of it. There is nothing to be passionate about in life and there is no reason to be grateful that you are subjected to life in general.",

The \"Rollercoaster\" of ups and downs I'm told is your body trying to adjust to the new levels of Serotonin building up on your system. That can take 2-12 weeks to stabilize. Everyone reacts differently. \nThe fluctuations in feeling tired might be due to the half-life of Lexapro. It does need to be taken consistently and build up on your system and the stabilize. \nI see some people play with taking it in the morning or at night. I suppose that depends on if they feel tired during the day or if taking at night makes them unable to sleep. \nCheck out the Lexapro section on here though. You won't run out of topics to drive yourself crazy over. I'd suggest reaching out more to your Dr. Reading too much can make you overwhelmed.",

I get so embarrassed I just want to disappear and be invisible.  I feel so alone. Nobody wants to be around the person who's always in trouble so I eat alone, walk alone and do everything alone. It fucks with my head. It gets so bad I noticed I can't focus on what's going on in the moment and I can't listen to everything because I'm zoned out, I miss more important information and then I continue messing up. Then I notice I stop eating and drinking water and I neglect myself because I don't feel I deserve it until I fix the issue.  Then I zone out and think about what I should do the next time, and try to think about everyone who cares about me. I have one friend and he cares about me and he calls me often but I noticed he only talks about himself and he keeps me on the phone for two hours each time and I don't have that free time and it punishes me mentally to hear him talk about himself and not let me  say anything but he's a kind person. I usually don't mind being alone but I need human interaction. I have an online girlfriend in another country I knew her for 10 years but now after all this time she's too lazy to meet in person and she says I can't visit her, and because she doesn't meet me halfway I completely lost interest in her and now I don't know how or if I should tell her because have almost no one in my life.

The more details you can give and the more honesty you bring into the process, the better.  They can't help you fix the problems if they don't know what the problems are.

 "text": "I\u2019m feeling worthless and down a lot lately and would like some perspectives that come from other people that could help me become stronger or challenge my difficult feelings I\u2019m currently recovering from a really bad anxious collapse that happened me over a year ago now. My mother had me when she was 20 (single mother) and met another man who she married and had my 3 siblings with. I never met my biological dad and gre up looking different to my peers. This caused me to be bullied by 4 different groups throughout my teens. I drank and used drugs to cope from 13-20 until I got brought to court and it was a wake up call. I went back to university as an adult, even got a scholarship after undergrad to go to another country but I never really felt confident about who I am or that I had any worth. Especially to women. I had one relationship in my 20s that lasted almost 5 years. I dated someone who I wasn\u2019t really physically attracted to. I did love her, she had a kind heart and took care of me. I always felt guilty though about not really feeling physical attraction for her. I think subconsciously I must have thought that the only type of love I was worthy of was from someone I would not feel attracted to or my perception that she was not what I felt was attractive meant she was less likely to abandon me. I know how narcissistic and awful that sounds trust me. I\u2019m just trying to be honest. When that relationship ended I decided that if I was going to date anyone again I must be attracted to them physically in some way at least. \nFast forward 6 years and I haven\u2019t been on a date since. I could count on one hand the amount of times I\u2019ve even been hugged since then. All my life I\u2019ve felt invisible to women. I really wanted to meet someone and start a family. I thought \u201cmost people meet someone eventually and get married, that will probably happen me too\u201d, well, it hasn\u2019t\nNow my focus is on trying to figure out ways of managing life with no one there to complement me, encourage me, or think of me for the next 20 years. Which is how it\u2019s been for most of the last 20. Sometimes I feel so down and sad. It\u2019s really tough trying to reassure yourself when you get so little validation from others. I feel like I will have to explain over and over to people in the future that I\u2019m not married and don\u2019t have a family. It makes my eyes fill with tears because I don\u2019t know why no women seemed to want me that I showed interest in. I don\u2019t know if it was looks or personality or my anxious standoffishness. \nI feel resentful when I hear about people who screwed people over and treated people badly while I was growing up now having wives and a couple kids, and the feel like I\u2019m worthless. When I was younger I felt bad because I felt invisible to girls then too. I don\u2019t think as people we were designed to be alone but I feel such strong rejection now that I have decided to give up on my hopes of having a family and try to find ways to live alone and be happy. I had the idea that I could donate some of my earnings to children in need anonymously as a way to show love to children. I also want to volunteer somewhere as a way to help I. The community. I really feel like the only way to experience less emotional pain in the future is by limiting the amount of interaction I have with people and keep to myself because when I see others with the things I\u2019m not able to achieve it gives me deep feelings of sadness. I\u2019m go to therapy and take medication but I\u2019m just r stuck and not feeling any better",

I did my work at home so when it was time to actually go in there was nothing for me to do but walk down that path.

Those quiet moments are gone, I can\u2019t feel like that again.

Have you seen a mental health specialist? \nThere are treatments for this, including certain meds, cognitive behavioral therapy, or transcranial magnetic stimulation. You might not find the right treatment at first, and might have to try different ones before you find the one that works, but you can get better. \nI finally stumbled on the right combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine, sometimes referred to as California rocket fuel. Those are two different antidepressants. They are often used together for treatment-resistant depression, and venlafaxine by itself is often used for anxiety.",

I'm studying to get into medical College and i have been preparing for it since 2021. Basically, mom had me choose this stream, i wanted to do something related to arts, but i ended up doing what mom said anyways. I used to study till last year, just because i didn't want to get embarassed in class, and i haven't failed any of my exams, but i still dont want to do anything related to medical. Now I'm feeling really tired of studying for something i don't want to do. I feel like I'm wasting my time for nothing. My classes ended in Nov, now since jan-feb, whole day i just feel like sitting on one place and stare into nothing. Mom expects me to study all the time so i just open my book in front of me and keep staring out of the window whole day. I don't have any friends so i don't have anyone to talk to, i used to love reading, baking, drawing, gaming but now i have completely lost interest in doing any of those, also I'm not allowed to do that, like i said mom expects me to study all the time. I literally haven't left my house for 2 years, except for school/classes. Mom tells me to study till at least 3 am and wake up by 7, then only I will get admission in good college, so i stay up till then just to satisfy my mom so i barely get 3-4 hrs of sleep everyday. And i just feel so tired of this, i just want all this to end. Even if i decide that maybe i should try to study for atleast an hour, my mind just wanders off somewhere else, i have zero concentration for few months. I keep wishing that i wasn't born and hope that something happens with me so i don't have to deal with this anymore. Also i feel really guilty that my mom spent so much for my school, books, etc and i cant even concentrate for 5 min. I feel bad that mom has spent so much money for education on someone like me, im done with my finals and i have passed those, but the entrance exams for college i keep wishing i fail cuz if i get admission in med college then i will be wasting my 5 years but if i fail mom's gonna be so disappointed in me. Idk i just feel guilty for cheating my mom like that, and i feel so pathetic for feeling like this, since I'm not the only one \"preparing\" for medical.\nAnyways ty for reading guys",

It is hard, but really it's your life, and imo you should strive to first and foremost make yourself happy. Have you talked with a doctor about your depression? \n\u200b\nalso, yeah we depressed folk are more often than not guilty of not sleeping enough, but it is really important.

I appreciate it but i don't think other things are gonna work, cuz i need to listen to what my mom says otherwise i get yelled at. Getting a pet, going out for a walk is gonna be distracting and all for me. 2 years back my sis did told my mom that maybe she should take me to psychiatrist since i might have social anxiety but mom just said stuff like nothing's wrong with me, I'm fine, so idk about that.",

I can't talk to anyone about it really because I struggle to verbalise it, so I'm going to type out my thought process on the matter and anyone who sees this can tell me what they think. Here we go. \nRegarding my present, I am 25, living with my girlfriend and her dad. I work in a little casino in a deprived area that actively makes people's lives worse, but I can't leave because of money. My girlfriend convinced me to do a degree in History because I love the subject however now I am at the point where I feel like this was a mistake because the job prospects are dismal. I have no friends. My life is work, uni work and hang out with my girlfriend.\nRegarding my future, what future do I have to look forward to? I have absolutely no purpose in life. I do not want kids. I wish I did, but I don't. I most likely will not have a fulfilling career. I probably won't make a lot of money. So what is the point? I might as well kill myself because I can already map out how my life is going, and it is not positive at all.",

The other tricks you into thinking that there are many other players and a cohesive world. (Reality)\nThis is my understanding. I think that reality becomes less fearful and depressing when we see it as a sort of dream that is just a little more structured. \nWe still have power over it, but it takes patience and diligence to make any progress. We have to learn to give up our need for a quick fix and for perfection and achievement or love. We need to learn to consistently come back to the present and to develop a grateful heart. Stop being so fucking selfish & spread a little joy. Do you want to be a part of the problem or the solution?",

I felt a little pressured by a friend to go to Spain since he came here with his family and people from my country isn't accepted in the USA due to so many people already there, I don't have as much money as my friend has and I'm constantly estressed about money, I went from spending $30 per month to spend over $250 and in my first three weeks I spent $700. I'm constantly worried about losing all my savings that are just enough to be here for a year maybe before having to find something in real life, the job situation is not the best here and I have to share appartment with other people and is constantly estressing me out.\nThere are still days when I'm just thinking about laying in bed to just die or go ahead and drown in a river, I thought I would somehow stop thinking about this stuff once here but it has actually gotten worse and I'm even thinking about going back to my awful country to die there instead...

We're trying on shoes having a hell of a fun time, until I try on shoes and they decide to roast me. \n-The first pair I tried on, my husband said if I buy/wear them he wouldn't be seen in public with me. He was not joking. Look of disgust included, free of charge.\n Our child decided to make gagging noises at them. \n-The second pair I tried on I was told I would never wear them anywhere because they don't fit my \"sad personality\" and I look like a \"depressed stormtrooper.\"\nLike WTF. I actually liked both pair of shoes and they fit who I truly am when I'm not hiding. \nMind you the store was very busy and multiple people heard them say this to me and looked at me with absolutely crushing pity. \n-I know it seems silly to be upset over shoes, but that's not it. I was actually genuinely happy and excited by something and haven't been in a long time.\n-Needless to say I have been silent since leaving the store. Like if I can't express myself with the people I'm supposed to be safe and supported by, wtf am I supposed to do?\n- I'm trying to not let this knock me off the positive path I'm on now, or be too sensitive about it but it's bothering me a lot.\nThoughts and opinions?",

I sat in my room alone as I started to ask myself \u201cam I real\u201d I went on Google and searched up what I was feeling the more posts I read the more I felt exactly how those people in the comment section felt. I felt like I was high and was about to faint. But I read Thoughts of those who said they wanted to die or those who said a lot of other things. I even called the suicidal hotline, as I am writing this I am starting to feel the symptoms again but this time I know better. To those of you who are struggling at the moment this might not be much help to you but it helped me today you do not need to stop thinking negative thoughts because the more you try the more it\u2019ll be instead focus your thoughts on something I know it\u2019s hard but even talking to someone at the moment might help you. Please and I mean please get yourself a therapist if you have not done so I am not a professional but today made me realize how important and intense suicidal thought can be. Your mind is one of the strongest weapons to ever exist and sometimes that weapon may turn against you, but it will not prosper. You\u2019re mind is very powerful and the things that you go through just proves that, your thoughts are not your reality and if you have not done so I advise you to go on YouTube and listen to Sadhguru he has helped me today. And I hope he\u2019ll help you too. I hope that soon you\u2019ll be okay enough to even leave this chat if you feel like. I hope you\u2019ll be happy again. I hope you\u2019ll have control over your life again and have a will to live. I hope you get better.",

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and to struggle with doing things that used to come easily to you.\nIt's great that you're trying to make positive changes by not smoking today, but please don't beat yourself up if you don't feel instantly better. Recovery is a process, and it takes time and effort to get to a better place.\nIt might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through. They can provide you with strategies for managing your symptoms, as well as help you work through any underlying issues that might be contributing to how you're feeling.\nIn the meantime, try to be kind to yourself. Allow yourself to rest and take things one day at a time. Remember that it's okay to ask for help, and that you don't have to go through this alone.\nI care about you and I'm here to support you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you ever need someone to talk to.\nFYI: I used to smoke for 15 years and it\u2019s been 2 years since I quit, I feel much better now.",

In the last year i started regularly going to therapy, and found some meds that work really well, and entered a new relationship with a very realistic but optimistic person (26, psych major for counseling and therapy, what a duo lol)\nWithin the last few months i cant help but feel impending doom. On the days where I\u2019m okay and my medication helps, i am great.\nOn the bad days its just exhausting. Ive been with my partner for over a year now, this is the healthiest relationship Ive ever had. I see endgame with him. We\u2019ve had little bumps but nothing we cant work through.\nWe both graduate in may (grad school for him) and i am just feeling major senioritis. I dont know what to do after school. Work until i die? When i was a preteen i didnt think i was going to make it to 18 so, what now?\nAgain, the days that are good are good, but some days i just feel that I\u2019ve messed up beyond repair. Ive messed my life up, or I\u2019m too messed up. My bf shows he loves me and is very understanding, but i feel insecure lately because i just love him so much and i feel like my mental problems will bring him down or make him sick of me. He says its not and that we\u2019re okay and I\u2019m okay. The joke is; every time im afraid of \u201cmessing up\u201d our relationship I apologize, and every time i apologize and over explain im like \u201cthis is the thing thats messing it up\u201d i feel that I\u2019m too messed up to fix, and Im not worth being in a relationship with.\nHe says he loves me and shows it and i have no reason not to believe him, but my brain tells me I\u2019m not deserving of that love.\nI cannot just act confident and ignore these instincts because i feel stupid for being confident that someone loves me, because i am not worth loving.\nWe will live about an hour apart during summer and that is stressing me out.\nI feel that i am existing just to exist. It is so painful to be aware of my impulsive thoughts and overthinking and anxious attachment style because i know its an issue and theres \u201cnothing\u201d i can do about it, and i feel like being aware of it will just manifest it.\nIts cyclical and sickening, i have a weight on my chest and it paralyzes me. I am so afraid of letting myself sabotage a relationship bc its going \u201ctoo smoothly\u201dthat i fear i am doing just that. Its so exhausting to be self aware. \nI am on meds that help and in therapy, and i WANT to be better, but i just cant make it go away. Now that im in my 20s im convinced it never will. I feel like a Sim doing my tasks every day just to make it to the next day",

 "text": "I don't see myself living for much longer I've made this throwaway as a couple of people I know know my main Reddit account. I'm 25 years old and have been living away from home for almost a year. I'm from Ireland but am living in London after following a big career opportunity, and so far it's going ok. A lot of downs, but a few ups so I guess it's all been balancing out.\nI guess I don't really have a segue to saying this, but I don't feel like I can live for much longer. I've no health complications/issues, I'm relatively healthy physically, but mentally I'm not ok. I feel sad and lonely a lot of the time. My family and girlfriend are back home and I miss them so much. I've noticed I've been drinking a lot over the last few months (not always getting shitfaced, but having something to get the lightest buzz) and whenever I visit home I smoke weed most nights. These substances make me feel a lot better than I do without.\nI've ticked off a number of things on my bucket list such as see my favourite band live, meet said favourite band, work in my desired career field, find a partner I feel happy with, move out of my parents house, etc. I know my bucket list isn't super exciting or long, but I can't think of anything else to add on to it.\nI spend most weekends at my flat, browsing the internet aimlessly and trying to find something to do with my couple of days off. Admittedly, a few weeks ago I'd gone out with a friend of mine for a few drinks and when I was waiting for my train to arrive, all I could think about was ending my life. It just came out of nowhere, I wasn't even feeling sad or helpless, it came into my head and took over - clearly I didn't act upon it. Since then I've realised that I don't see myself living much longer. I don't have a plan for ending my life, but I can't see myself living to 30 (that's only five years away). I struggle to plan for things that are less than a year away becasuse I put so little thought into the future, I just try and plan things day-by-day or week-by-week.\nI haven't expressed any of this with anyone in my life because I don't see them often or else they live back home, and I don't want to scare anyone. I don't really know what to do with myself.",

It wouldn't unfortunately be exactly like flying, but it might give you a means to engage in a hobby that your kids could also participate in. You need some time to unwind, really any time you can get, because if you don't, it'll just get more and more exhausting to live life.\nIt'll also make your life more difficult if you let this nostalgia over a past relationship consume you, but the only way you can overcome this is by making a change in your married life. If you want to continue your marriage, seek marriage counseling. If you don't, seek separation. Either way, you need to talk to your wife and express exactly how you feel.\nI wish you all the best, OP. If you can take a break today, take a walk or hang out with your kids. Whatever can make you feel just a bit of happiness.",

 "text": "I lost my uncle last night, 4 months after I lost my aunt (his wife) To preserve my privacy, I will refer to my uncle as \"R\", and my aunt as \"C\"\nIf you were to scroll far enough on my account, you would find the post I made the night C died, and how I felt that night. Overall, I felt fine, purely down to shock. I was not very close to C but if I bumped into her while she was at work, I would stop and say hello, or speak to her during parties. It was a rough time for my family, and very challenging for me to work through due to it being the first substantial death in my family, one that really affected me due to the reactions around me, and the utter guilt I felt from not experiencing grief. She died on the 20th of December, 5 days before Christmas, after falling into a sudden coma despite being overall healthy. The immediate news didn't affect me at all, nor the announcement of her death, but the funeral broke me. I had a panic attack as the curtain was drawn to transfer her coffin into the furnace. The next day, I overdosed.\nR died yesterday during a car jumpstart by just simply slumping over, and dying (heart attack). He was revived, but soon took another one and that was the end of his life. He was taken as quickly as C was, Many of my family members believe he died of a broken heart, which makes the entire situation so much worse for me to work through. It would be selfish of me to be upset about his death due to maybe speaking to him once or twice in my life, but when we used to talk about the couple, they were always talked about together, never individually, so for example, \"I'm going to C and R's house.\". I haven't really managed to grieve C's death, so grieving R's too is going to be so tough. I'm not nearly as mentally unwell as I was at the time of C's death, so this hasn't pushed me over the edge as far as I'm currently aware, but I'm sure I'll be able to figure that out after the initial shock has worn off\nTo finish, I am not a religious person, so I can't lean back on the idea that they have been reunited in heaven, however much I would love to take comfort in that idea. I wish I was religious to an extent so that I could have an answer or at least a sense of relief that they're together forever, but it's a cold, lonely world that I live in, and I know that this is the final journey. I know that as soon as C's eyes closed to submit to her coma, that was the last time R ever looked into his wife's soul.\nI'm getting too deep here, I apologise. I'm just upset.",

It's important to seek help and talk to someone about how you're feeling, whether it's a friend, family member, or a mental health professional.\nRemember that you are not alone in this, and that you are worthy of love and friendship. Try not to let negative thoughts take over and instead focus on your strengths and the things that make you unique. It's okay to take some time for yourself, but also consider reaching out to your friends and spending time with them. They may be more supportive than you think.\nFinally, don't be too hard on yourself. Everyone has their own struggles and insecurities, and it's okay to be imperfect. Be kind to yourself and take small steps towards building your confidence and self-esteem.",

He passed away almost 3 years ago and in the time we have celebrated him more than I have ever been celebrated. Mom and I were watching tv the other day and she remarked that she never had birthday parties growing up. I said neither did I. She disagreed telling me about all these parties until I pointed out that those parties were for my brother and sometimes sister. Then it was the same lecture I got after he died: \u201cit\u2019s not that he was the favorite it\u2019s just that he had a special relationship with my parents that me and my sister could never experience because he saved their marriage/made them parents/he was the only son.\u201d My birthday is usually forgotten because it\u2019s right around Thanksgiving. I had a sweet sixteen that wound up being more of a family party with pink decorations. \nBeing the one never chosen has effected me forever. I was such a pick me it must have been annoying. I was chosen first once in my life:by my husband, the greatest person I know. And I feel like he\u2019s lived to regret that choice. I\u2019ve tried to make life what we wanted but it seems to kick us in the ass at every turn because of me: employment issues for both but especially for me, medical issues on my side, two miscarriages in the last 2 years, living with our families the last 8 years of our 11 year marriage. And he\u2019s broken I think. \nNow he\u2019s going back to drinking and watching porn/playing pornographic video games constantly lying about it to me.

Somedays i just feel good and i say to myself \"yeah ok everything's gonna be alright you can make it\" and then, the day after it or even the same evening i just feel like i'm not able to do anything, i just lay in the bed and let the time go away. Also i'm having some problems with staying sober. Everyday after school, if i don't have weed to smoke i drink alcohol, if there is no alcohol i smoke weed, no matter what i just can't stay sober. And if i have to, i'm just angry all the time and avoid anyone, i just lay in the bed. I have hobbies and interests, even a dream work (psychiatrist lol), but i don't have the motivation to pursue them, so i'm always \"the same\". Hope someday i'll figure out how to make it all work.\nThank you.",

I have no disease , it\u2019s all fine expect my mental health ,anxiety and depression. Doctor told me to go to the therapist but we are poor people the college fees are already high enough to pay .",

I think the fact that I was \"supposed\" to be happy and celebrating but could only see how far I was from happiness.\nAnxiety might be the main cause of your breathing issues.\nIt's obvious that you need a friend to vent with.  I know how important that is.  I am in the same boat.  I have people to talk to but they either don't want to deal with my shit or they simply don't know how to.  My parents just shrug and tell me they don't know what to do.\nWhich just makes me feel worse.\nIf you want to vent, I'm here to listen.  I'm hoping this sub can help me, too.",

 "text": "Is it possible to get therapy from your college? Many colleges offer free counseling / therapy services for students. It's definitely something to look into while you're a student.\nRegardless, I really hope you feel better soon. If possible, pick up one thing that you can do that could help you feel better. Whether it's a pre-existing hobby or a new one, having something to do can help take your mind off of things and provide you with a source of joy, even if it's just for a little while. It may not solve your problems, but such a thing can help provide a little bit of relief.\nTreasure your mom and dad and spend time with them if you can. Whenever you feel ready, try to find friends in your area / college that can also provide you joy and support. Don't rush into socialization, especially since you aren't feeling well right now. \nTry to take it easy and just do what you need to do to survive. It's okay. You'll thank yourself for it later. Take small steps towards improving your mental health and your situation; change doesn't need to be immediate for it to be powerful and long-lasting.\nPlease don't give up. Take it slow and steady. Don't pressure yourself, especially during such a hard time. Give yourself the love you deserve.",

Why can't you hang on break and lunch or after school?\nIt's OK to feel these things, feelings and emotions just are what they are. Usually to tell us that something is off so we can attend to it. Unfortunately our emotions don't know what can be changed and what can't.\nIf you can't change it, you must accept it and use it to your advantage, not let it cause you a disadvantage.\nIt might be just what you need! You might meet a girl and hangout with her. Or now that you don't have too many distractions you can FOCUS on school and get good grades, graduate with honors, geta accepted to a better college and give you a better future.\nWho knows though right?... you can just sit back and watch and cry as it crumbles around you because you don't do anything about it.... OR \nYou can go in there tomorrow like you own the place, head high, that practiced (how you doin) expression (lol)\nfor the ladies.... and READY to take on what the unexpected throws your way!",

I have had small/minor bouts, but never anything this long term. I am typically a happy go lucky, outgoing, social person. Right now I feel so unlike myself. This depression had caused me to push important people in my life away. I\u2019ve said things I don\u2019t mean and I don\u2019t even know why. Why do we do these things when we are feeling this way? Why push people away when you need them most? I said things that are so hurtful. I can\u2019t take them back. Now the one person I had to lean on is gone.. because of the stupid stuff my mouth spewed when I was upset. I never want to hurt anyone. Especially when it some one I love. Dealing with a depression on top of a heartache feels so heavy, and I know it\u2019s my own fault. My hopes to anyone going through something similar, is to try and open up to the people who care. Do be stubborn and push them away. You don\u2019t want to lose them.",

Every culture has different standard, heck everyone has different standard. There are success story of certain parenting style, yet the same style is frowned upon elsewhere.\nBecause of it, there's no way to \"certify\" parents on how to raise kids. That means it makes sense for parents to raise their kids just like themselves, it's what they already know. Why would they try to experiment on their own kids? There's no guarantee other style would work better.\n\u200b\nI don't know why people romanticized adoption nowadays, be it human or pet. It sounds noble but not without trouble. Orphaned kids (or pet) tend to have mental issue like us. If a couple willing to do so, that's great, but most parents barely know how to raise normal kids.",

I thought I was getting better to be honest. Maybe I was, maybe I did get better but no matter what I do I always end up here. I get better but everytime I do I get worse as well. It's like im rising and the more I rise the harder I plummet. I'm so sick and tired of this. I really do want to give up, I cant take it anymore but I dont wanna leave my boyfriend. I wanna have a future with him, but I cant do this anymore.  I dont even know what to do in the future. I dont know what to do in the future, im going to college next year and I dont even know what course to take. I want to give my boyfriend everything in the future but I don't know how to, because I dont even know what career to do in the future. I dont have anything that im actually passionate about. I don't have anything that drives me. My boyfriend and my dog are the only reason I'm still here. This week I feel like my world revolves around my boyfriend. It's probably because im unconsciously clinging to my last reason to live. Im unconsciously making him my everything because I know that if I dont, I might actually do it. I ran out of motivation and reasons to live. He is the last reason and I'm clinging to it. Why cant I get better? I've been wanting to end it since I was 10 or 11 and now I'm 17 and im still suffering. Im still stagnant. I cant do this anymore. I promised him that I wont hurt myself, but I did 5 days ago and I did it again 20 minutes ago. I'm such a bad girlfriend, I feel like I'm draining him out because I keep telling him all my problems. I'm not doing well at school, I have been numb for days and then I was trying to study Math and it triggered me. I just started to breakdown because I cant understand it. How am I supposed to have a nice future If I cant even understand math. I'm not doing well with my family either nor with friends. My family keeps comparing me to my greatest friend and it's bs. My family isn't content with my scores nor with anything with me. I'm trying my best to get out of bed yet my family is here complaining about how I didn't get a perfect score or something. My family knows that my grandpa has been harassing me for years yet they turn a blind eye to it. My family emotionally abuses me and I cant take it. I want to stop caring about everyone's feelings but I cant leave my boyfriend. I really dont want to leave him. I'm trying hard to keep holding on but I just cant.",

 "text": "Autophobia is scary I wanted to reflect after reading another post that I feel summarizes depression quite well.\nWhat is it like to undergo depression? How does it feel? How does one deal with it? How important is it to be patient when dealing with depression?\nDepression affects everyone differently. Sometimes it's been inside the whole time, waiting to strike at the right moment. Other times it's something that will never really go away because of things beyond our control. This is my summary of how I've been feeling over the last couple months after 10+ years of hurt.\n\nI wasn't always like this. I used to dream of using technology to improve the world. Used to spend hours beat mixing albums and organizing / editing photos. Used to see value in working for a pittance. Used to be independent. Some people even say I used to smile in photographs. Not anymore. None of that matters when life feels like it's not progressing at all. What do you do when everything feels pointless?\nThe only thing keeping me going is a close group of friends who do stuff on weekends. Nothing else matters more than having people who will support my struggles, who I'd do the same for in return. The thought or actuality of losing those friends scares the crap out of me. I know the only constant in life is change, but Autophobia is real and hurts so much.\nNow, living at home isn't so bad; rent is cheap, we have family meals, and people are around. However, I can't help but feel like doing the same thing with the same people in the same house for 3+ decades is part of the problem. Our worldly socio-economic policies don't help either, but I know I can't change those so I'm trying not to focus on them too much.\nPart of me wants to move out, both to grow and live life to its fullest. However, I'm also deathly afraid of moving out without someone who will help keep my mind grounded, remind me to function, and be there when (not if) I have another mental breakdown. It's not my friends responsibility to watch over me, but I need friends around to help qualm my Autophobia.\nAll we can do is learn to cope with each passing day. I'm still at home, learning to cope as best I can, all while trying to find the motivation to move forward with life, whatever that looks like. I hope you can find peace in your life too, because we all deserve to live a fulfilling life with as little complications as necessary.",

 "text": "Has anyone attempted, survived and not grateful/happy it failed? I always hear stories of people who have made suicide attempts and despite the outcome of how it failed, are glad they survived it.\nBefore i was even 10, i made an attempt, failed. I was poor, my parents separately abandoned me and raised their own kids. I did all these checklist things. I found people who love me and regularly show they love me, lasting throughout more than a decade now. I went to school, got a doctorate. My job appreciates me (i feel) and i make 6 figures, a long way from dropping a gallon of milk and not being able to afford more for a week. I went to therapy, tried medications. I bought a new car, bought a house i wanted. Ive traveled alone, traveled internationally with friends. I go out, i socialize, i meet people and try to learn about their different human experiences. I sing karaoke and the crowd cheers, even though im not even vocally talented. I have people who regularly tell me and show me that they are there for me or at least can help or guide me. The worst part of my days are really just inconveniences or annoyances. I have my cat and my dog that are 11 and 14 respectively, ive had then since they were babies and they are well and happy and i think that also says a lot about me as a person. Most of the time i feel like i am genuine to myself and my values. Its a good life. \nBut even after all this, i was never glad my attempt failed. Everyday i wake and do things because its expected. The only thing that keeps me going is not wanting to bring sadness to anyone that loves me. I feel like its the only part of me that isnt truthful or genuine. I dont know why i dont love anything or anyone. I just say i love you to people because i couldnt bring any sadness to anyone that does love me. I cant bring myself to tell anyone that i dont love then back. \nIm stuck because i thought this is what i wanted to finally be happy and to love. I cant think of a better job. Or what more i could want from the people that surround me. I dont know what more i even want from me (except to be grateful or love something or just damn be happy). Between luck opportunity and hard work, i have a good life.\nBut still, I regret the attempt hadnt worked out.",

I feel really depressed and have experienced my first anxiety attack ever. Ever since I finished my degree I've been financially stressed but kept my just above water. Now this is my first time posting ever, and also I'm just so confussed about everything so sorry if this doesn't really makes sense.\nRecently though it feels as if my life is falling completely apart. My wife, the love of my life, and I do LARP with our group. Now, last time we went I got really tired, and we ended up having a fight when we got back home from the event. And that fight became the drop that made my glass overflow. My ex and I broke up after a LARP event because we had a fight and she ended up cheating on me, it wasn't very pretty and has left me with a fear of being left behind and loosing people.\nDuring the last event we went to, my wife's character got engaged to one of our very good friends' character. That on top of the fight, have apparently reignited my fears from my former trauma of the way my ex left me. They have been doing forum rp daily ever since the event so that their characters can get to know each other better; something we generally do in the group, but the added romantic relationship between my wife and friends' characters. At the same time, because of my fears I have started growing slightly possessive and am really working with that issue as well as the other issues I have. We've spent some time apart to try and deal with my fear of not being with her, in case she might leave then, and are currently apart again while she's gone to visit some friends.\nDuring these days however, it feels as if she's been withdrawing from me, not really answering me proberly or outright choosing to not engage with me in regards to any forum play we've been doing or in general, while I know she's been continuing with her own forumplay. My mind continues to make all sorts of scenarioes that scares me and just makes me want to have her in front of me and tell me she still loves me.\nMy depression and anxiety is growing worse, but I'm also afraid that if I keep communicating that to her, she'll grow annoyed and not want to spend time with me.\nI also have an appointment lined up with my doctor, as that might allow me to get financial aid with some therapy, but that is two weeks off and I feel as if I might crack any moment. I really don't know what to do and just need somewhere to vent. I've begun having these thoughts whether I'd just be saving us both a lot of pain by just running off and cutting ties to everything and starting over somewhere.. It's as if no matter what solution I'm thinking of there's no light at the end of the tunnel and I just have this fear that no matter how hard I try it's going to go wrong and she'll end up growing tired with the hardship anyway and end it..\nEverything just feels overwhelming",

The moment I start eating I'm afraid I'm going to get morbidly fat.\nPlaying videogames is always the fucking same. It feels like a chore now, everything does.

Specially Nirvana, Pink Floyd and Arctic Monkeys.\nEverything I've had has come to a routine of staring at the ceiling asking myself why am I wasting my \"golden years\" and listening to the same songs on repeat. \nI still can't get over some friendships I lost. It's been 3 fucking years and it stills hurst me how bad we did, she was a wonderful person and I managed to fuck it all up.\nI really feel like I'd die if someone didn't tell me to sleep or eat. Not like I care though.\nI'm tired of this. Everytime I start getting friends they end up leaving me because i fuck something up. It's just a thing I have to do with everyone, it seems.\nI don't live. I just exist. This can't be called living. And I'm so fucking tired of it. Is it so hard to have someone to sincerely love you? God I really wish I had someone to hug but instead my pillow has to replace that \"someone\" that I doubt will ever come.\nAnd for fuck's sake.

I tried to quit porn many times but it's hard because it's an addiction, It became even harder when I had to deal with narcissistic abuse that, alongside porn and other stuff, led me to depression. So now depression eats me alive and addiction became a coping mechanism and I've been stuck in that cycle for a while now.\nI keep going back and forth between believing that my life is 100% my responsibility and believing that I was happy before I got abused so abuse takes the most blame for my situation. The addiction started before the abuse but I wasn't depressed yet. That addiction became 4x worse after the abuse.\nSo, is it 100% my fault ? Am I waking up everyday with the intention of making myself sad ? Does the \"happiness is a choice\" mindset apply to that situation ? Because if so then i don't get to complain right ?",

 "text": "Did your meds (antidepressants) actually work the way they are supposed to? If you just felt like a vegetable, with little emotion, while on them, you were on the wrong meds. Mine were only working so-so. I changed to what some in the mental health field call California rocket fuel, and it made all the difference. It's a two-med combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine and has become popular as a first-line treatment with some MH professionals, and it is often used for treatment-resistant depression. \nI also went through TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation--nothing like electroconvulsive therapy) sessions, which improved things somewhat. My anxiety and depression scores were significantly improved over the course of TMS treatments. I can recommend them, based on my personal experience, but they don't improve things for everyone, though they have zero side effects, which is more than can be said for meds. TMS is covered by most insurance, I'm told, and Medicare covers it. \nThere is also talk therapy, which is highly recommended to go along with pharmaceutical treatments. \nIf you've tried all of the above, there are still other avenues to try.\nBack to antidepressants. Besides the TCAs, SSRIs, and SNRIs, there are at least a couple of tetracyclic types, and then there is the MAOIs. The latter usually do work, but require some dietary restrictions to avoid serious side effects. \nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-major-classes-of-antidepressants-1065086\nOf course, you are familar with feeling the sadness of depression, and we tend to go back to what we're familiar with, so I think I understand where you're coming from. But if you want to feel anything like normal (not like you're \"drugged\"), there are more things you can do.",

If that's keeping you from being with your friends or from making friends, it might help. \nFor some reason, we tend to isolate ourselves when we feel bad, just when we really need to be with friends. \nI do believe you can eventually not have to just endure life, and you'll find you enjoy life more instead. Not that you won't have sad periods, like when a loved one dies, you lose your job, etc., but that is a different kind of sadness that lightens up over time.",

This isn\u2019t particularly a question as much as it is me reaching out for any and all insight.\nAround November something kinda switched in me and I got severely depressed. I felt lost and like everything in my life was far away and no longer felt \u201cright\u201d. - I don\u2019t do well in the winter so combine seasonal depression with feeling lost in life in my late twenties, and trying to make life big changes but not knowing how or what to do\u2026 I\u2019ve been struggling. \nI was on Effexor for 4 years and despite feeling half numb and no sex drive it saved my life initially.

I wish I could blink and feel\nNormal and like myself again. The worst part is I know the tools to get through this but they aren\u2019t helping or making me feel less alone. \nMy doc keeps telling me to be patient with the lamictal but I\u2019m just desperate for relief. Any advice or encouraging words are appreciated.

It sounds like you've been struggling for a while now, and the winter months have only made things more difficult for you. I can totally understand how you feel, as winter can be a tough season for a lot of people.\nI'm glad to hear that you're seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, and that you're trying different medications to find something that works for you. It can be really frustrating when it takes a while for medications to start working, but it's important to remember that everyone's journey is different, and recovery is not always linear.\nHave you tried any other forms of treatment or self-care that might help you feel better? Sometimes, exercise, being outside in the sun, or practicing mindfulness can all help with managing depression. It might be worth exploring some other options and seeing if they work for you.\nI know it can feel really lonely when you're struggling with depression, but please know that you're not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Keep reaching out for help, and remember that things will get better with time.",

 "text": "A few days ago I literally saved someone from killing themselves! So for context I work for the NHS CAMHS (child and adolescent mental heath services) so technically it's my jobs and this isn't the first time I've technically saved but anyway. Point is was on escorted leave middle of town and they attempted to run into traffic, the result me and my colleague had to restrain them in the middle of town on a concrete path. Not ideal I know however safer then letting them run into traffic. Police came and helpted us return to the ward. \nSounds like a great thing preventing it but I cannot stop thinking about how terrified and potentially traumatised the witness's were, literally people that most likely havbt ever seen anything like that. I feel guilty that it even got that far, how did the nurses not see the risk before allowing leave  why were we not told about the risk, what could we have done differently. \nI'm struggling so much with the guilt of having thoes people see that. With the guilt of it getting that far (even tho wasn't my choice or decision). I look at the scrapes, bruises and cuts I have from the concrete. The bruises on my jaw amd chest from their kicks and punches and I can't not see how horrific it was for thoes people to witness. Just sucks how somthing that should be good can really get to your own mental health and can impact you. But I guess that's just part of the job. \nPeople are always shitting on CAHMS in the UK and don't get me wrong it needs a massive improvement but the support workers, thoes trying their upmost to change the lives of these kids, no one really knows the stuff we see or have to go through. \nI would like to say we did prevent them from injury, they are safe on the ward.",

(Bless her) The only problem is I was never disciplined or taught any real life skills/healthy habits. I got away with everything and never had to do anything for myself. I'm 30 now and have nothing to show for it. No job, no future prospects and I don't clean my room for MONTHS at a time. With the amount of food ordering we do, my room has become a bit of a hoarding problem...and I know I'm not blameless because I recognize how shit I am to her at times, but at the same time I feel resentful because I feel like it was my gmas job after she took me in to at least try to help fix the bad habits I developed my first 6 years of life. My gma is fucking 80 and I feel like a monster for feeling so hateful towards her...sorry for the wall of text, I desperately needed a vent lol",

Is this really a part of her response to medication? We did a follow-up check-up, and mentioned her suicidal thoughts and increasing anxiety. However, she was advised to just continue with her medication. I would like to know if any, among these, is aggravating her condition and exacerbating suicidal thoughts. Should she continue taking them as advised by her psychiatrist?\nLooking forward to your esteemed opinions. Thank you in advance!",

 "text": "I am a wreck So first of all, i am NOT suicidal, but i i think of myself that i am pretty messed up.\nI  do have a severe depression that manifested in its current form three  years ago, shortly after my father passed away. I\u00b4ve been half-orphan  almost all my life, and i think i never recovered or healed from the  death of my mother. She passed away shortly after my 6th birthday due to  cancer. Until this day i have an extrem fear of seperation in terms of  relationships. On both romantic and non-romantic relationships, but it  is worse with romantic relationships.\nMy  father fucked up everything that was humanly possible. He basically  made sure that all his children are traumatized by his inability to be a  good father. I recently found out he never wanted children, but after  the first arrived, he didnt care anymore how many we would become. His  whole life revolved around his sexual desires, ranging from  crossdressing, bdsm even to zoophilia. We found out by accident in our  early teens, and we never talked about it until he kind of came out to  us about it a couple of years afterwards.\nHe  uprooted us on many occasions, first we moved from town to town, later  even changing the country, in an effort to hide from taxes and other  issues he created. On one occasion he took us out of school for 5 years.  We were able to make up for it by not beeing the dumbest kids, but  still, it never gave us any fundation. When we have been abroad, he  didnt live with us, he left us alone in \"our\" house while living with  his Girlfriend of that time. Our age ranged from 8-13 when this started,  it lastet for 6-7 more years.\nWhen  i became a young adult, i met this woman online. She lived in my  homecountry, and i managed to visit her for 3 month. During that time  she had an affair with me, since she was unhappy with her partner. The  intimacy i was able to experience with this woman was off the chart for  me. I fell in love deeply with her, and she seemed to reflect that. We  did spent alot of time together, long and deep talks. But all of a  sudden she tried to distance herself from me. She did spent new years  eve with her boyfriend, but soon after we managed to see each other  again and told me how much she loves me. unfortuneately i  had to get  back abroad since i had no place i could stay in anymore. She distanced  herself for some reason i dont understand until this day. I even met her  boyfriend of that time, i never understood why she risked so much for  me and stilled got rid of me so quickly.\nHalf  a year later i met my wife with whom i have a wonderful child. We are  together for more than 15 years, and i would call it a good marriage. I  love her, i would do everything for her, we plan our live together and  do so quite succesfully. Apart from a lack of sex, i cant say anything  bad about our relationship. We shared almost all our secrets with each  other, except for me who keeps this recuring feeling for that affair for  himself. I do have a healthy and smart child, my wifes wage is decent,  and my wage is almost double of the national average.\nAll  in all i should be happy, but i am not. I endure my life. Long before  my depression started i ate to much, its a coping mechanism. Since the  severe depression it got alot worse. I almost financially ruined us by  eating way more than we could afford. We are currently recovering from  that, but it is still a struggle for me. Our financial situation we have  been in, did not help my depression. But ut least this is getting  better now thanks to my well paid job.\nThe  only reason i am able to do my job is stress. I work for one of the  biggest carmanufacturers on this planet, i take care for some of their  essential IT stuff. This stress is the only thing making me work. At  home i feel like a total failure, unable to do some of the basic chores.  I always have to force myself to do basic stuff. My child and wife  being somewhat of a motivation, but still not enough to brake my  crippling depression. I am unable to sleep.  Everytime i go to bed, my  thoughts turn around the idea of me being worthless. They revolve around  my inability to be the best husband and father i  could be.\nThe  fact that the woman from my past keeps coming back into my mind nearly  every fucking night is getting the rest of me. I am unable to heal the  wound that was inflicted by her. Unable to fix my life. Unable to become  the husband and father my wife and child deserve. I am on the way of  becoming somewhat of a shadow of my father. Not being good enough for my  child, giving her the future she deserves. It always feels like i am  cheating my wife, even though i never talked to this woman of the past  since she broke me. Sometimes i would like to write her a message, ask  if she ever loved me, if she regrets letting me go. For my job i had to  go to the customer, the car manufacturer, this is on the other side of  my homecounry (i moved back 15 years ago when i met my wife). The woman  from my past lives near their headquarter, i felt so sick driving to  this customer. I was very close to the hometown of this woman during  that week. I felt like throwing up, it felt like the \"breakup\" just  happened. I had the urge to drive to her hometown and just have a look  at my memories, at what was my past.\nI am broken, i dont think i can be fixed.\nI  do have a therapist, but this is a long and painstaking process without  knowing if it will be successful. The least i can do is to endure my  life and make sure that my wife and my child have a better life. At  least thats what i am telling myself everyday. I take meds for my  depression, but all they do on a good day is to keep me neutral. My joy  of life is long gone.",

Luckily for me my mum is a psychologist and she did some research into what might help, she discovered a branch of medications known as SNRI\u2019s - they have completely changed my life (specifically Venlafaxine) I feel like my old self, the world is colourful again, I\u2019m curious and am enjoying life, my family and the little things. I was 100% sure they wouldn\u2019t work and I\u2019ve been completely proven wrong. Depression is an ILLNESS, and like most illnesses, there is effective treatment out there, you just have to keep trying different medicines until you find the one that works for your brain. Please, if you haven\u2019t tried them, give them a go. If they don\u2019t work, give something else a go. On another separate point, depression can be a symptom of other underlying mental health disorders, such as ADHD. Get yourself to a psychiatrist (General practitioners do not really know what they are talking about) and find out what\u2019s really going on in your head. Good luck :)",

I feel paralysed in my own body and feel like I can only do the bare minimum to keep myself and son alive and work for money in the bank. \nI feel like I\u2019m making my husband disappointed and annoyed by slacking which makes me feel guilty and more worthless. \nThe amount of times driving to work I have considered just driving into a tree. But I don\u2019t because the innocent eyes of my son are looking at me with pure reliance on me. I can\u2019t leave my son without a mum. \nHow do I get out of this slump? I literally feel paralysed",

There\u2019s no point in living, but whatever, maybe I\u2019ll find a reason someday to distract myself from the fact that there actually isn\u2019t a reason. \nAnyway, I sort of went into this \u201cIt is what it is, there\u2019s no point in getting mad/sad about this since I can\u2019t control the situation, I\u2019ll just accept everything.\u201d kind of mindset after a mental breakdown recently. I stopped waiting for replies, stopped expecting things, nothing interests me, and time just passes by. \nEverything just feels so unusual ever since. Like.. I just don\u2019t feel any strong emotions and I\u2019m neither happy or sad. Just something feels off and empty. \nI have everything I want in life, I just started attending the dream school I wanted to go to, people like me, I have a lot of friends, I\u2019m doing something I\u2019ve dreamt of, a good opportunity that I\u2019ve always wanted came to me a few days ago, and it just feels not that big you know? It\u2019s just like \u201cOh.. that\u2019s good. Ok\u201d and I\u2019m not feeling as happy as I thought. When I heard I got into the school, I was really happy but then it\u2019s just like, \u201c..Now what? The only goal that gave me motivation is now achieved. Was I just distracting myself the whole time?\u201d \nI tried giving myself goals, but nothing really motivates me, I tried looking for things I could do, and nothing interests me. I feel numb. \nI never truly feel connected to anyone in a group of people and it\u2019s so frustrating because I genuinely don\u2019t know why. I can make friends easily, and they all like me and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted. I make jokes around them, but honestly, I don\u2019t really feel anything when socializing with people. They all seem to enjoy the convo and they all seem happy and I just can\u2019t understand HOW they\u2019re happy. When we\u2019re all talking in a group I go along well with everyone, I laugh when they laugh, but I just feel incredibly alone and empty inside even when surrounded by people. \nI\u2019m jealous of other people, they all seem so happy and it makes me think, \u201cWhy do I think like this? Can\u2019t I just think like them and be happy? How do they believe that there\u2019s meaning in their life?\u201d When I see random people being happy with their life, I think \u201cWhat makes them so happy? Wish I were them.\u201d \nI started avoiding one of my close friends because she\u2019s really successful and when I\u2019m near her, I feel bad about myself. She\u2019s one of the sweetest person I\u2019ve ever met but when I\u2019m near her, it\u2019s like her positive energy just turns into negative for me. She\u2019s so enthusiastic and motivated that it makes me realize how miserable I actually am. \nI literally don\u2019t understand why I think like this. Is it because I have childhood trauma? Bullying? Parental problems? But why is it affecting me now? I don\u2019t wanna kill myself, because I won\u2019t be able to do it myself, I just don\u2019t wanna exist . Am I just being overly sensitive.. who knows",

Years of being laughed at make me so scared just to make a post on social media.\nI don't know how to connect with others, so Ive tried to reach out online. But the internet is an awful place - I reached out for help about being abused after my mom died, and the top response was someone telling me to stop playing the victim. Nothing gives me joy. I have no hopes or dreams for myself.  I can't sleep. I can't cry.  There's this unreachable empty feeling in me.  \nMy family doesn't care, they just want money from me. Constantly, every week or so, a new request for a few hundred dollars, and the lie that I'll get it back. I watched my uncle point a gun at his daughter, and his son body slammed my cousin, and no one did anything. My aunt was raped and drunk herself to death, and all my family had to say was that she was a lying fool.  When she threw up blood in front of me after begging me to call an ambulance, no one actually looped around to check on her. And no one checked on me.  No one checked one me while my parents screamed at each other. No one cared when my mom died in front of me and I had to become a mom to my younger sibling. No one cared when my cheating father snuck off and married a random lady who to this day sees me as a rival for his love.  Instead I was blamed for my mom's death and asked why I let my dad do these things.\nI was a kid. I was a fucking child.\nAnd instead of recognizing that I'm traumatized and need a hug, people instead will shrug and label me as weird. My aunts will tell me to stop throwing pity parties and stop whining. That's all my family has ever done.\nAnd the country I live in?  Land of the free?  I'm seeing laws pile up that threaten my very existence. I can't go to the psychiatrist without going into debt. This country is awful.\nAnd no one cares. No one ever cares.  Every reddit post and throwaway I've made over the years. No response, not even an attempt to pretend to be concerned. I would hurt myself if I weren't scared of pain.",

People suggest writing down things you\u2019re thankful for or that you can conceptualize feeling good about even if that is extremely difficult. I\u2019m not saying it won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re not brainwashing yourself, and honestly that might not be a terrible way of thinking about it although it devalues the process. What you\u2019re dealing with is fucking difficult. Use any advantage over it you can think of, including medication even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019ll work-taking an SSRI or an SNRI takes three seconds total, you don\u2019t have to convince yourself to really believe it\u2019ll work, just entertain the possibility for three seconds every day",

 "text": "My mom's boyfriend is making me feel more and more miserable (this turned out to be a huge rant about everything) It's building up inside of me each day, I have to live with them every day of my life, and every day is the same, when he came to this house, my mom said it was a friend that had nowhere to stay and was gonna stay for some days, it's been 2 years, and I can't stand him, he thinks he knows it all, everything that I do, although not to my face, he mocks and talks about it, always complaining to my mom, and then she complains to me, never telling me it was him that complained but I hear them talking shit, he doesn't work, hasn't worked for like an year even though my mom has a huge debt, he's just a parasite living here like it's all his, I don't feel comfortable, I don't have my privacy.\nHe, sometimes, comes into my room and takes stuff whenever I'm at work, at first it was a doubt of mine, then I started to test it, and I was right, he sometimes takes money, cigs, weed, rolling papers, etc. all of that when I'm not home, without asking. And it's not like he's discret, because, even if it's the last of that thing that I have, he'll still take it, no warning, then I get home, I don't have this thing that I was looking forward to have, even though I'm sure I saved it for later.\nThis comes piling up for months now, I'm getting worse mentally each day, everyone at working is starting to despise me because I'm such in an angry mood all the time, even though I asked them for a lighter schedule because I was not in the right place mentally, this request was completely ignored, they kept giving me the worst shifts possible, their words being \"we can't give you lighter schedules because we need you here\", well, I sucked it up for months, letting it ruin even more my mental state, I asked them again for it, and they say I'm being lazy, that I don't want to work, that other people aren't complaining, etc. I tried to explain to them, without giving much information, because, tbh, they don't need to know, I tried to explain that it was for my mental health, that I started having anxiety attacks every day when I started to work those hours, even though I've never had anxiety attacks before, and I tried to ask them to not have me do those hours, it led to a big argument and them saying no.\nI just can't do anything, It's not that I don't want to do stuff, I just can't. Everyone shames me because I don't have my drivers license, and I've been postponing it for years, and that I'm being lazy, and I need to do this, or that, or I won't go anywhere in life, and that hurts, because I want to do those things, and I try to explain that I want to do those things, I just can't. I don't care that I won't go anywhere in life, because, right now, that's exactly what I want, to not go anywhere in life, I don't really want to die, but I feel like I wanna kms, it's not that I don't want to live at all, I just don't want to live this life.\nAlthough it only got worse these last couple years, I might be depressed since I was, like, 15, when my parents separated, and I never really thought about how much of a trauma it might have caused me, because I never talked about it, never even thought about it, I just completely erased it from my memory until recently when I started to think on everything. that's also when I started smoking and doing drugs, started doing bad in school and the only reason I even stayed at school was because of a girl that I really liked and a couple friends, I eventually left school without completing it, which I now regret and it's making me feel even more hopeless. When I left school, I started working, then I met my ex girlfriend from a friend at work, stayed with her for 2 years, might have been one of the happiest moments of my life, eventually, came covid, we lost our jobs, stayed at home together 24/7, it started go downhill where she'd get mad at me and then I'd start crying, she eventually got diagnosed with depression, started taking pills, she wasn't getting mad at everything but she said she felt numb with them, so she stopped taking them, I never gave my thoughts on this, since I didn't want to control her and I wanted her to deal with it how she felt she had to, even though it meant she being mad 24/7, I think it was somewhere around this time that she stopped loving me, I started feeling it, and it was eating me inside that I knew that the best thing that I had in life was going to leave, I was feeling it for months before it happened, and, stupid me, instead of trying to make things right, instead of trying to make her see why she loved me in the first place, I started feeling hopeless, I didn't do anything, then I'd get mad at myself for not doing anything, looking back, I could've done things way better, but oh well, a couple months go by, covid is \"safer\" now, she said she wanted to start going out with her friends again, and I was actually really happy about it and encouraged it, one day she left for a sleep over, I took her to the door, kissed her and said I loved her, she said she loved me too, then she goes 4 days without talking to me, no calls, no texts, nothing. She then texts me saying that she couldn't come back, that she can't keep doing it and she'd be here in some days to take all her stuff, that happened, I cried, she cried, we hugged, I begged her to stay, and then she left, I was destroyed, but deep down I was actually happy(?) for her, because she could find better. Fast forward 1 year (it was around this time that my mom's boyfriend came to the house), I have my job, I'm starting to feel a little bit better, my ex calls me, says that there's some stuff that she forgot and if I could bring it to her, which I said yes, went to meet her, gave her her stuff and she asked if I wanted to go smoke a joint and talk, because she wanted to talk to me, I accepted, we smoked, went for dinner, and then we were talking and that's when she said that she was hospitalized for 2 weeks and that was her second day out, and as soon as she got out, she wanted to call me and talk to me, she was hospitalized because she tried to kill herself, she overdosed but her mom found her in time and she could make it. When I heard that, I didn't say anything, I just didn't know what to say, and I'm not sure if that made her mad, but I just couldn't find the words.. she talked about it, although, while showing no reaction, I listened to everything she said and I still remember all the words she said. And that was it, we went our ways, as soon as I left, I started crying like I never did before, because, I was one of the big factors on her depression, and not a positive factor, and I'm responsible for it to leading to this, and I'm so glad that she didn't die, that haunts me to this day.. I wanted to stay friends, and she said she wanted to, but everytime I tried to make plans with her she'd push me away and she said that she can't actually be friends because it hurts her, so that's the last I've known of her, I know she's alive because of instagram and I talk to her dad frequently. \nThat's about it, I'm a mess, my mental health is a mess and this post is a mess, I just wrote everything that was piling up, and I'm so sorry if this is confusing, if you decide to read this, but, that's the best way I can put this..",

 "text": "Knowing there are treatments that will work might motivate a person. Some doctors don't try different types of meds, but there are 5 types of antidepressants, along with cognitive behavioral therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For severe cases, there is even electroconvulsive therapy, which works, but has possible undesirable side effects. The latter is not painful, as you're under sedation while it happens. I've never had it, but if nothing else worked, I might have tried it after a scary depressive episode when I was off my meds. Lesson learned: I needed them and very quickly after taking the meds again I was much better, but still had room for improvement. I just needed a different med added to what I was already taking, and then I felt what I think is normal.",

 "text": "Don't give up hope, because there is a treatment that will work for you. There are meds of various types like TCAs, SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, and tetracyclic antidepressants. There is talk therapy like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), and then there's TMS, or transcranial magnetic stimulation.\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-major-classes-of-antidepressants-1065086\nWhich works for you may be different from what works for me. I have treatment resistant depression. I was recently put on what some call California rocket fuel, or venlafaxine and mirtazapine together (two antidepressants that work differently) and have never felt better. I don't feel drugged like some say they feel when on an antidepressant, and I can enjoy things much more now than before. \nI went through TMS therapy and that certainly helped. But the change in antidepressants made more of a difference. \nIf you've lost the motivation to continue looking for a treatment that works because so many treatments just didn't work, don't give up. I didn't, and I FINALLY found what works for me, AFTER 67 years. (I've had depression my entire life.) I gave up trying for a long time and just put up with depression, but I tried TMS, and after that, the California rocket fuel combination, and I finally feel normal, able to really enjoy things in life. \nDon't give up, but don't wait decades to get the help you need, You may need a combination of things, like perhaps CBT and an antidepressant that works for YOU. Maybe you would do well with am MAOI (they're not first-line meds because you have to watch what you eat to avoid serious side effects, but they do almost always work). So there is hope. You just need to keep trying, like I did.",

I used to lie in bed at night, watch YouTube, keep myself from laughter so my parents wouldn't come in to my room and tell be to bed, nowadays I have to force myself to laugh. I can still have fun and actually laugh with my friends but those moments are slowly starting to dissappear. I keep telling myself that life will get better, I might meet a girl, maybe make some new friends but I'm starting to give up on that hope more and more now. So now I lie here in my bed, writing this and waiting for life to just end. I know there are so many people that have it worse than me and that I should be happy with all I have but it's just so hard to do. This isn't a cry for help or anything like that I just wanted to get this off my chest to just make it a little bit better but deep down I know it won't change anything.\nThanks for reading this I guess.",

Kind of hard to explain. But my therapist says I have to go to coda meetings but I don\u2019t want to fucking put in work anymore and I don\u2019t like the advice he gives me anymore.

They are probably under the impression that you aren't sure exactly what your problem is.\nIf you really need someone to recognize what you are going through and comfort you instead of a diagnosis, then trying opening up more with a close friend.

She's really nice to me for whatever reason, and in most ways she's just as broken as I am, if not more. Which is sad to say, but at least we can help each other. She admitted to me a few weeks ago that she had a crush on me, although it's a very complicated situation.\nShe already has a boyfriend. And he treats her like shit. He controls her, blackmails her, and even physically forces her to do what he wants. And she's not lying, I've seen it myself. She tells me that she's completely lost interest in him, and that she wants to be with me but she doesn't break up with him and I don't know why. She says she wants to, but she just doesn't. And I get that maybe it'll take time, but at the same time I don't know how to feel when I see them holding hands and cuddling.\nI'm not sure what to do. Because I really do have feelings for her, a lot of them. But at the same time, she's with another dude. And I've made it clear to her that her and I aren't a thing until she breaks it off with him and she understood. But she just won't choose and I'm not sure what to do. \nI'm just afraid. Because i know that my whole life I've had no one. And the first time I've finally found someone, it gives me at least a bit of hope. But I know that if I lose this it's going to be really bad for me. I just don't know what to do. Please someone give me some advice. Please.",

 "text": "2 big things, first is that you should talk to her about how bad mentally and physically it hurts her. She needs to feel safe enough to break up with him without being worried about him afterwards, but it is also very important that she does it in safe way to make sure he won\u2019t do anything to her.\nAnd for you specifically, and I mean this, never rely on someone enough that you have only known for even a few years, to much. Being to secure with someone that could stop talking to you, to far mentally down, etc can make things worse. It\u2019s hard especially when they are one of the few people that you have been close with to set boundaries (especially this early on) but trust me. You can do this :))",

But at this point, I'm tired of going through everything alone. It's not just that I'm totally reliant on her because of me caring for her, at least not totally. It's also just the principle. The fact that i don't have anyone else, never had anyone else, and probably won't ever have anyone else again. I do care about her a lot, but it's also just partially because other than myself, she's all I've got. And I'm fed up with myself",

Personally, if you can work up the resolve to cut her off completely and not end up crawling back in short order, I'd recommend doing that. Probably explain it a bit, that it's just not healthy for you, maybe it'll spur her to the right course of action. But you have to commit to it. If you can't commit to it, everyone will be worse for wear.",

There is a phenomenon, probably not specific to women, where someone will use another person who's on the same emotional wavelength to supplement a relationship with someone they're otherwise attracted to but who isn't there emotionally (or is even abusive).\nIt's not necessarily her fault, and certainly not yours. If you do take my advice though, odds are that her other relationship will fall apart, or she'll just glom onto someone else for emotional support.\nI've been a benefactor of my own advice but it's a risky maneuver!",

 "text": "I've been replaced by my best friend, I just wanna die. I've been in love with my best friend for two years, and they're the only person I never get tired of. The thing is, constantly ever since a year and a half ago, they'd ignore me for weeks, sometimes even a couple months straight. They've always been very sweet to me whenever they weren't ignoring me, and I've always tried my best to give them the love they deserve. They said they like me too, and a couple days ago they told me they wanted to move in with me and that they love me, but just yesterday they announced that they had a crush on this person they met three days ago. We're not dating, but we'd been in that awkward phase for a long time where we're just friends but we acted like a couple. I tried asking them out a year ago but they rejected me, and since then I've been waiting for them to make the move. Since then, they've been ignoring me more and more, and I've tried talking to them about it millions of times, they apologize, and then do the same thing again. So I tried to move on, and they know it too, because I gave them everything and that wasn't good enough to make them talk to me, and I didn't wanna pressure them. However, I can't move on, and I love them too much, but after their recent announcement, I just feel shocked that I'm the person whose given so much to be with them, trying my best to treat them the way they deserve, and also apologizing when I realize I was wrong, but they choose somebody they met three days ago. I feel like I want to die, they've been the only person there for me all these years, and now I may lose them.\nI feel like it's wrong for me to feel this way, because I'm trying to move on, why can't they? But then I feel like I'm only trying to move on because I have no other choice, but I still can't move on, and I've given up. They know I love them, they've said they loved me too, and then they just do this bullshit to me a few days later. I don't know if it's something fair or if I'm in the wrong or..?",

 "text": "How can you figure out what's wrong with you if you can't even do basic things to get to the places or people that will help you? I'm 22, almost 23 now. Been suffering something pretty bad mentally since around 2019, and it's just been getting worse and worse.\nI don't feel comfortable around my family. I can't tell them anything about me, never felt like I could. My parents would always give me the \"You can come to us whenever you don't feel okay\", but whenever I would, I'd get a lecture along the lines of \"Seriously? Do you have any idea of how Me and your other parent feel? Working 40 hours of week, cooking dinner, cleaning, taking care of 8 kids, and paying off this house? What could You possibly have to be Sad about?\" So I gave up trying to confide in my parents, let alone my family. My brothers were the only ones I was able to really hang a round as a kid, and they treated me like shit. (I don't really entirely blame them, I was a fucking stupid and obnoxious kid who was really inconsiderate. Still though, it didn't help that confiding my feelings was seen as \"Gay\" or \"F*ggy\" to them, and they'd push me around for \"acting like a girl\". They're nicer these days, but the damage is done already. You know?) My sisters weren't too terrible to me as a kid. They were pretty generally polite to me most of the time, but they had their moments where they could be pretty harsh, and even mean. But definitely no where near as bad as my brothers. My late oldest brother never did anything bad to me as a kid and has always been a good older brother, and a good role model. My other brothers were Really bad, though. There's a lot of extremely deep-routed trauma here, but I won't go into that right now..  \nThey was the stuff I really dealt with as a kid. As an adult, my parents are constantly pressuring me to find a career to stick to that makes good money, and to buy my own car and move out. They've been on me about it since I was 16. I still don't have my license. I have really bad nightmares and anxiety about driving, I'm terrified of dying or killing someone else in a car accident, damaging my parents or someone elses cars/property, etc. Lately getting some driving practice in has alleviated a bit of that anxiety, but I haven't been able to practice driving in a Long while, so the anxiety is starting to come back quite a bit, and I have No confidence in taking a driving test anymore, so I plan to ask my friend to help me learn to drive. The only problem is that he works overtime practically every week, and I feel bad to take him away from his super rare days off, even though I know he'd set aside a day just for me, like the angel he is.\nMy biggest problem (among many) is that I have a Really hard time asking others for help. I think it comes down to trust, but only to some extent. The aforementioned friend is someone I trust with everything, but I think my reluctance with him is that I don't wanna inconvenience him on his rare off-time. With my family, I just don't trust them, I feel Extremely uncomfortable around them, and I don't like hanging out with them. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, I do, it's really hard to be saying all this about them, but it's true. I don't like being around them, I don't feel like I can be myself, truly. I don't feel like they like me and only try to get me to hang with them out of obligation, and because I isolate myself in my room 24/7. They always say the same shit whenever they have a get together and I spend most of my time in my room. \"We missed you today, don't you like hanging out with us?\" or in the chance I appear downstairs with them, they try to drag me into their convos or beg me to hang out, or even guilt trip me into it. But what's annoying is, even if I do, they don't ever try to really include me or value my opinion on anything. They always wanna do things I'm not interested in, and they'll think I'm selfish for wanting to do my own thing instead of forcing myself to do something I don't enjoy in order to spend time with them.\nMy mom reluctantly let our dad give me and my brother our own PC in our room. (He is a super tech-guy. Has worked at a tech company for practically my whole life, is super into testing new gaming shit like consoles, peripherals, PC parts, tech in general. He's always made somewhat decent money, so me and my family were fairly fortunate enough to have a lot of PCs and consoles for gaming and school, so I can't really complain there. He was always very absent when I was a kid cause he worked a lot. I held him in high regards when I was younger cause for the most part, he's always been a nice guy. As of late though, I've discovered some unfortunately bigoted things about him. Him joining in on pressuring me hasn't helped my opinion of him, either.) Eventually, when we were teens, my brother and I got our own PCs, but only He could have his in our room, mine had to stay out in the loft, where Everyone could see and hear me. It was scary and I had No privacy, ever. And despite he and I being in the same age range, my moms excuse at the time was \"He's older\", but even when I reached his age, I still couldn't move my pc into there. Eventually she finally told me \"If I let you move your pc into your room, me and your siblings will Never see you.\" Which, yes, was, and still is true. It still Frustrates me that she still hasn't ever stopped to think about just why that is, exactly. It's like she thinks that I'm just being unreasonable, and a bad person by wanting to get away from them.. They just can't see how they're pushing me away until I break and finally say something. But I know if I do, it's just gonna make things SO Much harder for me, even more than they already are.\nBut eventually, she finally let me move my PC into my room. I still had no privacy cause I shared my room with my brother, and he had just started dating a girl (Who's now his wife), and they constantly wrestled and screamed and fucked in the room while I was in there. It was awkward and embarrassing to have to be around it, but I always tried my best to just isolate myself to my PC and ignore them with Music and Games. (This is funny btw, cause I was Never allowed to have Any girls in my room, but he was. She feigned shock when I told her about what they did while I was in the room. God it seriously fucking pisses me off how comically differently she treated me and my brother.)\nMy brother moved a few years ago and I finally have a bit of privacy these days, and god, even this teeny, Tiny bit of privacy is so heavenly. I don't have to be around any of them, talk to any of them, or worry about them seeing what I'm doing. (I gotta be careful with my volume and what I say tho, I have an EXTREMELY loud voice that carries way too easily, so even if my door is closed, people can still hear me a lot of the time if I'm not careful.)\nLately, I've discovered myself quite a lot while spending time with friends, or even just spending time by myself. In 2018 I discovered that I was attracted to other men, and in general felt a lot more feminine. In 2021, I started to feel like I might want to transition, but only ever just thought about it. Over that year, I built up the courage to confide in my friends about what I was thinking and feeling. They were all very supportive, and encouraging. In 2022, I got Super drunk around my friends, and basically told them how Badly I really wanted to be a girl. How I had even thought of what name I'd go by, the clothes I had bought to wear, the kind of stuff I'd make about it, etc. It was super out of nowhere, but again, they were super nice, and supportive about it. The next day when I was sober, they talked to me about it, and it gave me the courage to finally go through with it. I identify as a trans woman, and I plan to go through with transitioning when I move out this year. I wanna do it as soon as I possibly can, but I absolutely can Not while I live in this house with my parents. I have no idea how they'd react, but based on some things they've expressed in the past, I don't think it would end well..  \nAs of late, I've been absolutely Aching to escape. I seriously Never leave my room now, unless it's for the bathroom, work, or food. That's it. I really feel out of place, and like I don't belong around my family. I feel like my autism, adhd, and ptsd have gotten Really bad. Almost everything bothers and sets me off, and a Lot of shit just randomly triggers really bad, painful, or uncomfortable memories. It's gotten to a point where I start to feel a ton of anxiety, and like I'm generally overwhelmed around them. It's really bad, and I just wanna get out of here so I can be the person I desperately want to be. It's not going to just magically make me happy with life or anything, but it will make me comfortable. Comfortable with myself, and just generally comfortable living my life. And that's all I want.  \nI can't drive, my friend who can is Super mega busy all the time, and I Really want to get help. Mental help, especially. I need to get out of this house, and I feel like the mental issues I'm dealing with right now are a Huge reason as to why I haven't been able to do a Lot of the things I Need to do, like learning to drive, getting a car, etc. The SUPER Rare times I've built up the courage to subtly confess to my mom that I wanna get tested for Autism or Depression, she Always finds a way to downplay it, or change the subject. She doesn't want to accept that there's something wrong with me. That or she just doesn't want to help me unless it's an immediate medical emergency, or work. I need to get help and diagnosed, because I feel like it might help me Finally do the things I NEED to do to live on my own. I just, don't possibly know how I can. I'm lost, and I'm scared.",

My job usually has me pretty isolated. It's rare that I'm around people let alone anyone I would have anything in common with. Social media and dating apps provide no results. I hate bars and clubs. I mostly just work now. I can fake it... With social interactions but I don't really find myself in those anymore. I noticed the rules changing in my 20s. You couldn't just talk to strangers anymore. Now it's almost taboo to just walk up and start a conversation. I've had some time off lately, 2 weeks here and 2 weeks there. I can't stay in a book, a show, a movie, a game, I have no interest in my guitar or music stuff, I have other things I've picked up and put down. I recently noticed since I've been off work that a few hours or so after waking up and starting my day I have an overwhelming wave of exhaustion come over me. Yesterday I let it take me but I only napped maybe an hour if that. Whether or not I nap I still have to do a ritual to get to sleep. Tea, melatonin, zzzquil, neck pillow, eye mask, ear plugs, the works. When I'm off I'm located in a small TX Town. I'm not from here. I don't really know anyone and people are really weird. I have no viable way to make any acquaintances or friends. Maybe this is it? I am 37. My parents never had much in the way of a social life, but they did have each other, me and my siblings and the rest of the family. I literally have no one aside from a few relatives and old contacts, all of which are pretty toxic people. This comes and goes but it's been a lot more intense lately. Maybe I'm just not distracted enough? Maybe I just need to go back to work? I have this mindset of making up for lost time because I had a pretty shitty start at life. Am I a workaholic? I've heard the word thrown around but I've never really been sure if it applies to me or not. I go to the gym when I can, I try to do things out in the yard and on a ranch property nearby just to... Idk honestly. I just do it. I haven't had sex in over a year and honestly I wasn't satisfied with my last encounter and she was just kind of not a likeable person. I played the game and got in. That's the other part when it comes to the opposite sex... I have the capacity to play the games but I've grown really tired of them. With people in general it's not often that you can be genuine, with women especially. I'm not sure what I hope to learn by posting here. I thought it may be a good idea. I'm open to some advice. No I don't have suicidal thoughts or anything like that at all... I'm too stubborn for any of that. Thanks in advance.",

Aa you grow older, you lose more and more until one day you die and leave everything behind. Until then we try to forget reality as best we can and delude ourselves. We try to fill a void with anything we can but only end up on a wheel going round and round and round. If you ask me, society itself is mentally ill. They just don't know it because its the norm. We're so used to the madness that we no longer see it clearly for what it is.\nSo don't feel too bad when your telling yourself that your messed up. The whole world is fucked. People are uncaring and lacking basic human qualities. The leaders are cruel, good people are suffering, animals and people are being harmed greatly etc...\nI despise the evil in this world and always will. I hope hell is real.

 "text": "I think you just get used to not being happy, and accepting that\u2019s something you\u2019ll feel less than others. It\u2019s tiring but finding ways to cope can really help, and a significant portion of people who do even experiences remission, at least for a time. \nIn the mean time, I just see it like this: some people have a physical disability that means they, for instance, can\u2019t walk. They\u2019ll miss out on things normal people who can walk do, things that are deemed necessary, things that bring joy. But they get used to it and find ways around it to survive anyway. \nHaving a mental illness just means your life is limited, but it doesn\u2019t have to be over. Seek treatment before you give up, in the mean time take what you can. Sometimes if I haven\u2019t slept or if I can actually get out of bed I go for a walk in the park and buy a nice drink from the coffee shop. It doesn\u2019t make me happy the way it used to, but the park is pretty, the coffee tastes nice, the music in my headphones sounds good. It makes me feel almost content, if not happy. You won\u2019t necessarily always feel sad, you just might not feel happy. Sometimes accepting that\u2019s how it is for now is the best you\u2019ll get.",

I don't remember what it's like to feel happy. It doesn't help that I can't actually focus on something useful due to ADHD. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, but my parents think I \"grew out of it\" which is literally impossible. They refuse to believe me. No game is enjoyable anymore. It all just becomes insanely repetitive. The same thing over and over. And I'm in no position to get a new game. Any free one completely sucks. Even the good games are completely uninteresting. My home life completely sucks. My dad being the main cause. It's stressful just being near him. I brought it up near him once, hoping to talk about a solution, but I couldn't even finish my sentence before he pinned me to a corner. Eventually he let me go, and I felt the urge to escape from him. So I barricaded myself in my room. Eventually things calmed down, and we talked it out. And things got all better. Heh. I wish. He didn't get any better. Sure, he got less physical, but every other aspect got twice as bad. Now, if I'm late to the bus, even by a second, I lose internet for 24 hours and it doubles each time. I wanted to forgive him all those days ago. I wanted to feel positively towards him. Now the only feeling left is intense animosity. School is extremely busy. I'm talking computer science, precalc, US history, and chemistry. And all my teachers LOVE assigning large projects at the same time. And frequently too. As if they are the only class I have. It's so much that I can't get myself to do any of it. I am incapable of looking at the smaller picture and focusing on one chunk at a time. I think about any part of it and I practically shut down. I don't feel like there's any path forward. Just downward. And I'm hitting every branch on my way down. But I don't have a way to reach out. No close friends to talk to. No family that I can actually share my issues with (the last one I could share with fucking DIED). This hole is only sinking deeper. And eventually, it's going to collapse. I need a way out of the hole before that. Yet, to escape would mean putting my family in another one. I don't know how I can proceed.",

I am a massive disappointment to my parents, I never could give them what a son should, I never made them feel what a son should. I am a fking failure and I don't think this will ever change. My months of effort amount to nothing. Other people put half the effort and get rewarded 100x more. I envy everyone. What's the point of living if nothing ever excites you to wake up in the morning. What is the point of living if nothing makes you genuinely happy anymore. Nobody gives two fucks about me. All my friends despite knowing I am depressed never try to talk to me. The only people who will be sad if I ever die would be my family, but atleast that would prevent them from being disappointed every day if I continued living. i don't seem to change no matter how much effort I put in to improve. Perhaps, some people are born to be a failure and unfortunately I am one of them.",

I'll say this:\nPanic and stress are caused whenever you're feeling like you've lost control. If you've lost control then what can be done? Nothing. We're stressed, unsure of what to do, and give it enough time and it'll get into a panic attack where you feel trapped and possibly freeze. You've probably felt that at least once in your life. So the principle so to speak over panic/stress is hopefully clear.\nNow whenever you're feeling in control, generally your life will be less stressed. Now in terms of how it should be done - you've gotta know how to trust yourself in that area. Am I good at figuring out solutions? What's the worst that could happen in X situation, would I be lost? Or it'll feel uncomfortable and pass after a couple minutes? (If you've got specific cases lemme know and I'll try to hlep with it).\nProcessing traumas is tough, again I'm unsure how much you're willing to read all I've to say.\nI'll say this:\nAbout your mom  -do you feel anger towards her? Unforgiveness? If so with that I can definitely help, but it'll take time. With time you'll heal. I don't claim to have every answer to your situation, but whatever I can help with that I've dealt in my past and got out of I'll do my best to help you.

 "text": "The only way I can explain it is like this: It's like having an unbearable back pain. You change the mattress, work on your posture, stretch, soak with Epsom salt, but the pain is always there. There's no reason why anything should hurt so you go to the Dr who puts you through all the possible testing, scans, ultrasound, x-rays, and there is no logical or scientific explanation for the pain you're feeling. But it's there, it exists, it's crippling, and it's starting to paralyze you. No medication or physical therapy can bring comfort. It takes the joy out of your life, the taste away from the food, it numbs your skin, it clouds your vision, the only thing you can do is be in bed and sleep. Sleep makes you forget about the pain for a bit. At this point you're tired and sore and the only thing that can make it all stop, is death. But the guilt you feel for wanting to die is almost as bad as the invisible back pain itself.\nI can't really help you... I can barely help myself, but I can tell you what has given me some comfort: make sure that she has food, and drinks enough water, and sleeps in a clean bed. Offer her fresh clothes, help her shower, or take a bath. Hand her the toothbrush with toothpaste. Sometimes you may have to literally take her to the tub, and soap her up. For those days when that's too much, find compromises, dry shampoo, mouthwash, and baby wipes will do.\nYou can only help her survive this.",

But I am never stratified with any achievements or milestones that I hit.\nI have no real stress in my life, a roof over my head, food on the table etc. But there is just a black cloud hanging over my head, I always feel like something is weighing me down but in the back of my mind is always an extreme fear that my life is coming to an end one day at a time. \nI am entering my middle years and I feel so much of my youth has been wasted.\nI just deep down want to live a \"normal\" life and not have to worry about all the depression for a while, but it never seems to go away no matter how much I lift, how much cardio I do, how much money I make etc. It's exhausting.",

Im 20 and this will be my first home away from family. \nMy problem: actually packing to leave. In the past the only time I\u2019ve ever had to pack was during traumatic experiences. Being ripped from my childhood home, being kicked to the streets by my bio mother, and having to move in from the streets with my bio father. So, just packing up my tiny room of junk at my dads house feels like I\u2019m about to enter another round of horrible trauma. It\u2019s not a lot of stuff, but every time I start packing tears start falling and I end up spiraling. I\u2019ve been procrastinating it. \nAt this point, I\u2019m going to have to smoke a lot of weed and just start throwing things in trash bags because it\u2019s easier than actually boxing them and it gets it done faster. But the thing with that is, I\u2019ve only ever moved in trash bags. This is my chance to actually have a proper move instead of being given the old foster system carrier. \nI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t share this with anyone because everyone thinks I\u2019m so excited to be out on my own. And obviously my living situation isn\u2019t the safest. My dad and his family are all out on vacation right now without me and I\u2019m meant to be getting my shit ready to be taken to my apartment. My bio sister is taking me out tomorrow and I might try to talk to her, but we haven\u2019t talked much since we got separated. \nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really know what to do with myself.",

Had a full mental breakdown. Really struggle to do anything at all. I have bad anxiety in addition to depression and am waiting to be assessed for autism and adhd which are both very likely. Since being off work I have left the house definitely less than ten times, I don\u2019t go out as I am far too anxious. I have anxiety attacks when I\u2019m just chilling in bed ffs. I don\u2019t speak to any friends and I have no bandwidth to be around people. I am constantly exhausted and have no motivation or energy to do anything. Unfortunately this means that a lot of household tasks have fallen on my mum, even to the extent of her cooking meals for me. She makes me food every day and when she doesn\u2019t I don\u2019t eat. Today she being short with me and then exploded with me about how I never help her and I\u2019m selfish which really upset me and has been on repeat in my head all day, she went out after saying it and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. She is also struggling to look after my grandma who has early dementia and is in complete denial about it. She says I\u2019m selfish for not helping her with my grandma. \nNow I completely understand her frustration at having so many things to do and I know that she is struggling too, but I can\u2019t help her. I tried to help by not changing my clothes as often and only using minimal crockery to ease some of the workload but I am not able to do anything else rn. I currently cannot make myself wash or make food or anything. It\u2019s so difficult because I feel like a piece of shit stressing my mum out but I don\u2019t know what the hell to do when I can\u2019t do anything. I feel like such a fucking burden all the time and wish I could just switch it off.  She also said it\u2019s been the same situation for months which hurt as well, as if I haven\u2019t been trying to get  better when in reality the doctor and I haven\u2019t found the right medication for me yet and I\u2019ve been waiting for therapy treatment since June. I feel there is only so much I can do alone. \nAm I being selfish or am I just poorly?",

I noticed a lot of superficial cuts on her arms and got her in for a psychological evaluation last summer. She was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD and started Zoloft. It noticeably helped with her OCD symtoms, but the rest stayed about the same. Last month she told me she thought a lot about killing herself was really afraid she might actually do it. She said she comes close sometimes then talks herself out of it. We went to her Dr who sent us to urgent care and she was taken to a behavioral health inpatient program 2 hours away. There\u2019s no inpatient for adolescents here even though it\u2019s a decent sized city with multiple hospitals. They upped the Zoloft and added seroquil to her meds, hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety.\nWhile she was gone I did my best to set up outpatient care The psychologist told me she needs to be in an intensive outpatient program after discharge, but there\u2019s nothing like that here. I found an intensive outpatient program online that involves 3 hours of virtual group therapy 3 days a week, one hour of individual therapy and one hour of family therapy once a week for 12 weeks. So 11 hours of virtual therapy for 12 weeks plus I planned on taking her to in person counseling once a week, and just that was nearly impossible to find. All the therapists and and behavioral clinics here have long waiting lists. I bought safes and locked up meds and anything else that could be a danger. She hates the social aspect of school, but her grades are great and I read that adolescent suicide rates drastically increase during the school year so I told her she could finish the year out online. Her absences this year were off the charts and I thought that would help. \nShe came home after two weeks and three days later she told me that she lied about how she felt to the drs because she wanted to come home. She said that was a mistake and that she was really scared of hurting herself. She said I\u2019d forgotten to roll the dial on the combo lock box after I got her meds that morning and she took the her antidepressants out planning to take the whole bottle but when she texted a friend to say goodbye they talked her out of it. She went back to the hospital last night. \nI\u2019m a single parent without much of a support system. My parents work a lot and we\u2019re all struggling financially. I have to work full time Monday through Friday in order to provide for us. I just don\u2019t know what more I can do, but I\u2019ll do anything I can. She\u2019s everything to me.",

I was put into intensive outpatient program and it did help. The main thing it helps with is coping mechanisms but it definitely is no permanent solution. And do no expect therapy to immediately make all problems go away it just doesn\u2019t work like that. But I think the most helpful thing would be the group therapy. It really offers good peer support and just gives a safe space to be open about how you are feeling. Sorry if this wasn\u2019t very helpful best wishes to you and your daughter.",

Maybe some very expensive private practice psychiatrists can provide therapy and drugs, but even psychiatrists usually only prescribe drugs here and you\u2019d have to be rich to expect anything more, despite the country having a piss poor version of socialized healthcare. Anyways, I don\u2019t think those two are considered likely sources of abuse. Not saying it\u2019s impossible, but I doubt doctors need to file a report to prescribe either. Did you gain a lot of weight on Mirtrazipine? I gained about 50 pounds in maybe two months.",

It\u2019s bullshit but most of them come from wealthy families so what can you expect. Still, go to the hospital. They might have discharged you because they are actually overwhelmed with possible patients, like you said a lot of doctors won\u2019t do routine mental health prescriptions. Working in a mental health ward might pay well, but there is no doubt it\u2019s stressful as fuck so have more faith that they don\u2019t only do it for money. The others shouldn\u2019t be able to keep their jobs, but it\u2019s what it is. Doctors can make sky high stacks by moving to small town USA that has the infrastructure of a third world country and lots do, not always their choice either apparently but I don\u2019t buy the sympathy articles. Doctors used to be working class and proud of it.",

Ive tried a lot of different modalities and have found nothing is more trustworthy than working with the body.

 "text": "intense, mind-boggling mood swings? hey team. since my latest (and my worst) depressive episode, ive been experiencing horrible mood swings. i'll go from having random bouts of intense anxiety, to feeling suicidal, to feeling empty and numb, to feeling so okay that i can't even believe there's anything clinically wrong with me. it's at a point where i feel like i can no longer trust myself or my feelings, and i don't feel safe in myself. my therapist told me recently she thinks i have \"bpd symptoms\" (but won't diagnose me), and i know affective instability is a key part of that. but i can't tell if this is just good ol depression mood swings or if it's bpd. anyway, curious to hear if others have experienced anything similar as well with their depression, and sending love to you all",

Depression essentially has made me isolate myself from most of my friends, and it makes it hard to really even want to reach out. Yet, this same terrible thing now makes me feel so incredibly lonely that I hate that I've isolated myself from everyone.\nAnd I fear, even if someone knows to reach out to me, I won't be able to reply well. Maybe once I'll make an effort, then I'll tire and I'll put off talking.\nThe good thing is distracting myself by reading or crocheting or drawing helps. At least there's that.\nBut I can't stop hating all of this.\nI feel so fucking helpless.\nBut I guess at least I see my therapist again soon, so that's something. \nAh I just wanted to get this out, I guess now I feel slightly better after typing it out.

 "text": "Not making sense, but depressed ** I just need to vent and rant and none of this will probably make sense but whatever. **\nwordsalad\nI don't understand how people are maintaining happiness when the world is the way it is. To do anything in life you have to play by the game of a system they set up. Follow rules, policies, fees, penalties, processes, etc. Etc. Etc., Especially if it has anything to do with money. And we all know that these rules etc. don't necessarily come from well intentioned places. \nPeople look out for themselves, for those they care about, not the vast unknown amount of people. It's become a common method of living for some people, who choose a path of walking on others and using them to raise themselves up. Being sus and sketch and making our system beneficial to the few and only the few. But this behaviour has consequences, of which I see and feel every day. From people living paycheck to paycheck, to more and more people going on services such as food banks, income assistance, etc. It's become impossible to afford living, food prices have raised, gas prices are rediculous, you have to pay to get to work then pay to park to work then work and not make enough to pay for anything. You take extra work, but then you get burnt out, your trying to maintain some essence of a standard of living, but due to rental prices can't afford a safer location. Your mental health just keeps taking hits after hits. You move to help with prices, more bad shit happens that is the exact same. Friends die, your pain increases, your health worsens, people are yanked and pulled out of your life, friend no foe, stress, you yourself start getting diagnosed and have to then pivot to try and manage life. Life feels like a constant fight for survival... How can anyone starting out have any hope of owning a home, affording a family, having a yard for children to play in, etc. Not everyone has families that can buy them houses and help them out. Some people are in this world alone, trying to learn it alone, trying to figure it out alone. Living shouldn't be barely surviving to line the pockets of the people we elect to take care of us. Wake up, work, function, sleep, repeat. Don't get anywhere, don't have anything, just suck it up and take it.\nBut eventually the functioning slows, putters, sometimes stops altogether. Your mental health and depression is so bad. Fighting for help is even worse. Can't get better unless you pay. Can't pay unless you work, can't work unless your better... There is so much unfair shit in the world. Why do parents even try to keep things fair? They're just going to have disappointed children with trauma from realizing how unfair the world is. No one at the top is looking down going let's take money from the wealthy to help make life more equal and fair. They're the ones telling us you need a pen and then selling it to us because they bought all the pens before telling you you needed one. Covid, now a war, of course because they don't care about human lives more than money and being a dominating economic country. Because money is on the top and that's all that matters bull fucking shit. I'm done not making sense now... The world sucks and it's why I'm depressed and I have no hope that things will get better because it's a constant band aid",

I am always on edge now around my wife and family and don't really know how to tell them I've been feeling the call of the void, especially since my daughter is now almost a year and a half old. It's taken a huge toll on my relationship with my wife and I'm pretty sure she's ready to call it quits.. I feel drained by life and have just been absent lately. The slightest bit of effort is overwhelming and I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. My wife says I need to go to therapy, but I've been thru that and it felt absolutely useless because I still don't know how to be open and vulnerable like that. I just need to tell someone somewhere how much I hate being alive rn and I wish it would just stop. Does this feeling stop?",

 "text": "Solo travelling with depressive episodes Hi guys! \nI wanted to ask if anybody was in the same situation and how it played out in your experience. \nI'm about to travel solo for a month through South east Asia. I have travelled alone before but not for that long and not backpacking. \nI struggle with what I call depressive episodes. Not sure if it would qualify as full blown depression but when I'm low it's an unbearable low. \nNow, I don't have anybody really. Family does not live in the same country and don't have much contact to them. No real friends as I don't like socialising and just moved to a new country. I recently resigned from my job which was ultimately the right decision but it took the last pillar of routine from me and given that I'm as lonely as it gets I'm afraid that if I spiral down i have nothing really to come back for, if that makes sense. \nPpl who struggle and travelled alone in the past, did it help with depression or did it make you feel overall worse? \nThanks for reading! Appreciate it :)",

With that being said, I think traveling can help you get out of your head and be more present. It can give you an often needed change of perspective and sense of adventure. You say you don\u2019t like socializing but I bet you\u2019d meet interesting and nice people. \nTraveling won\u2019t cure you or anything like that so I\u2019d recommend coming up with a plan to cope when depression hits you. Go into this situation knowing you will have difficulties. For instance if something goes wrong, try not to be so hard on yourself and do damage control. I know when things go wrong for me or I make a stupid mistake I can spiral downward super quick. Maybe take a couple of rest days in a town you like instead of moving on to meet a schedule. If you feel like quitting, I recommend that you wait a couple days and reconsider. Persevering through hardship will make it easier to do so later on.\nI definitely recommend you do it if you have the opportunity.",

 "text": "I don't think I can do this for much longer I ve been struggling with depression for years. and lately it's been at worst it's ever been. On the surface, I should have been happy and looking forward to the future (I have a beautiful and amazing GF, we live together in a nice flat, with her two cats, overall a sweet picture) but deep down inside I am barely hanging on.\nSuicidal thoughts have been really hard to shake off lately. I know I have ADHD (diagnosed) and narcissistic traits (obviouse when looking at my behaviour objectively) my GF also suspects I might be bipolar ( her therapist suggested that, and based on my behavioural patterns that checks out). \nI have been going to the gym regularly for over 6 months, eating healthy and am in the best PHYSICAL shape I have ever been in. Also have been microdosing psylocibin. That and the love of my GF and her cats is what still keeps me afloat. \nSince 2020 I have been struggling financially and mentally, I got made redundant from two jobs in a row and ended up in one that was supposed to pay well (commission), but turned out not to. And I find it really boring and stagnant, so for the past few months I have been dreading going in there and coming back home feeling drained and unmotivated.\nI am 30yo, without a career, in debt, can barely afford to take my GF out for a date (well, can't really). \nI want to change the field, but all of the worthwhile ideas require an investment to get qualified. \nI feel stuck. I used to have a therapist, but right now I can not afford 2 sessions a month with her. And I was not really ever opening up to her well enough to let her help me to begin with. \nI struggle with talking about my own emotions and feelings and accepting help and support. I was raised to \"handle things\" and \"be a man\" ( yeah, I know.... I'm eastern European, we are not great at feelings)\nLast night we had a fight and she told me that she is tired and can't do this anymore. I can't blame her, I know that I'm a nightmare to live with when I am so tired of living and so bitter about the position I ended up in.\nShe deserves better, someone who will be a happy and supportive partner, not a sad burden that can not get himself to a visit at the shrink to get the meds that I know I need. I just can't get myself to do this on my own. Which is funny because I am working full time and very rarely fail to turn up to work or hide from my colleagues how poorly I am inside (only 2 that I became friends with know that I am struggling).\nI only know how to put on a mask and pretend that I'm ok but not how to process how I'm feeling and get better.\nBeing a good partner for her used to make me proud and happy, but I have been failing at that for quite a while now. \nNothing made me feel really any better for quite some time. \nI don't want to die, bit I don't want the life I have and I don't feel like I am capable of getting it to the point where it's worth living.\nToday I packed a rope in my bag when I left for work. I don't know if I can handle going home and making eye contact with her. I feel like I failed at life",

High school phase is done.\nI noticed that my only friend from that time hangs out with the people that bullied me, I haven't seen him for almost a year, most of my classmates from that year all hang out with each other, travel, they do a lot of things together.\nI spent a couple of mins checking out their FB, they are all having normal social lives and here I am, all my accounts are empty, I have no one to call, no one to hang out with, nobody cares if I disappear or turn my phone off.\nSometimes I wonder, is it normal for a person to be like this? Your average Joe has friends, hangs out with someone atleast once? twice a week maybe? maybe more, depends on how close friendships are, so what, a couple of times a month...?\nCompared to Me? I'm a fucking nobody dude, I walk alone, I go to restaurants alone, every hobby that I like I have to share it with myself, with this fucked up head of mine, some other things I will never be able to really really enjoy because I'm always alone, walking around the city, I do feel like a freak sometimes, I still see myself as that person, who gets regularly bullied but yet, I'm just the same as everyone else.\nEvery time I try reaching out, no one cares, excuses, bullshit all the time, people telling me to do things on my own and enjoy them but that will never be the case, it is a lie because they wouldn't tell that to themselves, so tell me please, this is it? What the fuck am I supposed to do for the rest of my fucking life? Walk around alone while I see friends, couples walking around and I'm always alone?

Humans are thus ever in pursuit of sources capable of providing them with ongoing happiness, but such isn't always easy to find. These sources don't have to be external, but when a person finds reason to hate themself, they are naturally deprived of internal comfort that might otherwise help sustain them through hard times, hence the many sayings regarding learning to love yourself as a person. While I don't know how realistic that is, it is worth trying to come to terms with the reality of who you are as a person and stop loathing yourself without good reason.",

Maybe I'm just literally not built to experience happiness, but I can't remember the last time I ever thought to myself: \"Man, I am so unconditionally happy and at peace right now!\"\nSure, there have been happy thoughts, and fleeting moments of happiness, but the burden of life always sucks me back down eventually.\nIs happiness all just one big distraction from reality, or is it actually possible to feel that way?",

They don't recognise each happy moment they experience and blog it in a sub. Also, they are not unconditionally happy. No one is. That's daft. At most, people feel satisfied. We are at a baseline until a variable in life either makes us feel happier or otherwise. Yes, our base-lines may differ but an unconditionally happy base-line isn't achievable. Self-satisfaction is and that can make it easier to experience feelings of happiness.\nNow, stop thinking so much about happiness and feelings and just go live your life and enjoy!!",

I now live with a chronic spine injury and he somehow got out unscathed. Not even stitches. This isn\u2019t necessary to the story, but he would constantly flex to me and his friends how he\u2019s okay and he\u2019s now gone onto making six figures at a new job with this \u201cI survived\u201d mindset. It\u2019s been a year and I\u2019m still in chronic pain. I\u2019ve had to quit all of my sports. I have constant brain fog. Anxiety. Depression. Hair loss. Before the accident, I was a ball of sunshine and always smiled. He was completely oblivious to my situation and I was too traumatized to tell him ab my recovery (he also doesn\u2019t have memory of the accident whereas I remember everything). I see this man every day try to make me jealous because I no longer talk to him. He still speeds. He was speeding while I was still in the hospital in so much pain, passing out, unconscious. He was flexing in the hospital mirrors. He was locking lips with drunk women while saying to my face \u201cI love you\u201d during my period of bed rest. He talks to people in front of me to make me jealous if he thinks that I\u2019m finally finding happiness in one of the darkest periods of my life. I yelled at him once and he\u2019s only gotten worse. He\u2019s made the situation about himself. Apparently he\u2019s the real victim. There are some way worse things he\u2019s done, but for legal reasons I won\u2019t say. He\u2019s the worst person I\u2019ve met in my life and I don\u2019t want to blame him for what\u2019s he\u2019s done to me, but he ruined my life. I will never be able to erase what he did to me. He sees my guy friends and inserts himself with them, and my guy friends don\u2019t know the extent of the accident. He lives in his own world and people eat that shit up\u2014I would\u2019ve too had I not almost died by him. I\u2019ve felt betrayed and stupid for the things I can\u2019t take back. \nThe only thing keeping me going is the fact I\u2019ll prob get money from the law suit. I plan on spending it on plastic surgery to fix my nonexistent self confidence to mask the pain I feel on a daily basis with different pain. I\u2019m 18. If I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m going to at least do everything I can to make myself wanna stay here, even if it means spending money. Honestly tho, things could always be worse. Despite how bad I feel daily, I want to try to stay here in case some day it\u2019s all worth it. Because in the end, we\u2019re all just waiting for that one moment we think will never come",

 "text": "I'm about to call the 3114 and it'll probably change my life but i need your help to be able to explain properly a part of my problem. 3114 is the french suicide prevention number, i really need to call them. In order to prepare myself mentally to make this call and explain my situation entirely  i am preparing a list of topics I would like to discuss and i'm taking notes about different things. There's something that i don't really understand about my situation (hence this post) and i feel like i won't be able to explain it properly.\nBasically i oscillate between two moods.  \nI baptized the first one Dark sasuke:\nIt's a permanent state of deep sadness, i easily cry, i do heavy self-depreciation, I feel like i'm an useless/worthless pile of flesh who'll never accomplish anything in his lifetime, it would be better for humanity if i'm dead, if i'm sent to a psych ward it will be a waste of public money and maybe I'll take the place of someone who needs it a lot more than I do,  Etc etc i think you get my point.  \nThe second :\nWay less self depreciation, no sadness, I'm calm, i'm more optimistic about my future, and i tend to minimize/doubt the sadness and the suicidal thoughts i had when i was previously in \"\"\"\"the other mood\"\"\"\".  \nI have no clue about what triggers either mood and there are things that don't change no matter my mental state. Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities (even meeting my family), Sleep disturbance, lack of energy, etc.\nHave you ever experienced something similar to my current situation ? Is there a funny scientific word that describes it ?  If you've ever talked to your therapist about it, what did he say ?  \n\u200b\nSorry, as you can guess English is not my first language and i have some struggles to put my thoughts into words (Dysgraphia).",

When we hide our emotions from those closest to us it can be really hard and a heavy burden to bear because where is our space to just be fully ourselves with those that we love? You're open to therapy which is already a good thing here. and it sounds like you perhaps need to find a better therapist. Don't worry about the family not agreeing with you doing therapy, I have that too, in my case I hide my emotions so damn well they have no idea why on earth I would even need therapy (other than some losses in the family). A good therapist is a wonderful thing, I hope you find one. I've also wanted to end it but my family have kept me here, I couldn't do it to them. So what else can we do but keep going and do our best to show up as best as we can? I really hope the best for you OP",

As a husband you really must learn to master your emotions and learn not all of them are worth dwelling on. The hardest one to learn is to love. You must know that love is an action and it doesn\u2019t come from a feeling. Sometimes putting your own things aside to help or support your partner is really difficult. Even when you don\u2019t feel loved yourself you must act on love. It really does affect your wife and how she reacts and treats you.

Medication, exercise, eating well, etc. can also help, but the truth is that none of them will be a silver bullet - they all help incrementally.\nThe fear of being judged is really scary, I understand that. The good thing about a therapist is that they are there to help you, not to judge you. It's a completely different thing from talking to your close ones about your problems. I find I can be more radically honest to my therapists than my friends and family, because they have the tools to deal with the insane shit that goes on in my head.\nAs for the crying, everyone deserves to express their emotions. When you're alone and need to cry, you're not hurting any one else by doing it. The lingering societal expectation that men shouldn't cry is such bullshit, and you don't deserve to be weighed down by that. Cry if you need to! \u2764\ufe0f",

 "text": "Venting my trauma / life You really don't need to read this, just need to vent about my past and try to have some form of getting it out of my head.\nMy dad moved away to get a job when I was around 11/12 (major recession and my parents were dead broke at this point). I went from seeing him every day to 2 weeks out of the year. We were constantly being told whether we were moving/not moving, leaving me in limbo if I was leaving all my friends/family behind (we never moved despite putting our home for sale). This ultimately strained my parent's marriage and they got divorced.\nMy mom tried to commit suicide when I was 14, I read her suicide notes that night and said nothing about it (she still doesn't know). If it wasn't for her friends and my brother she would have taken her own life while I sat in a room hoping she was going to be okay. She spent weeks in the hospital and it was just my brother and I trying to keep it together at age 14/17 but he was never home.\nA year or so later my grandma was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia that she fought for 2 years before she decided not to go through chemo anymore and passed shortly after.\nMy brother was a drug addict, who is now clean from hard drugs but has become an alcoholic. He was emotionally unavailable and impossible to talk to without him getting angry.  I used to look up to him so much. I wanted to do everything he did. I started becoming scared to talk to him, let alone try to get his advice or have a serious conversation.\nI fell in love at the end of high school. This girl took all the pain away. She distracted me from the fact that my family had fallen apart. I moved away for school and things came crashing down. She lied to me and broke my heart. This caused my first major depressive episode. I was extremely suicidal for 2 months and depressed for 2 years. One night I was really low, I drank a bunch of vodka and took the rest of my Ativan, I still have no memory of what happened the night...I just woke up. I still want to talk to her during my low points.\nEvery time I get low I look back on my past and always feel like it haunts me. I have so much regret for some of the decisions I made and things I said to the people that mattered to me. There were so many conversations I was too weak and scared to have that could have solved so many issues. I wish I could go back and re-live my high school / early college years since I missed so much trying to isolate myself.\nI'm now in a fairly healthy relationship for the past 5 years. But I've slipped again. My depression has crept its way back and I can't get my past out of my head. My brain wants to isolate and burn down the life I've made for myself.\nAm I really happy? Should I just end things so I can try to deal with my shit? I burdened my last relationship with my issues and it almost killed me. Why do I have to feel empty all the time? Why can't I let go of my ex?",

 "text": "How should this be approached? Hello, I am feeling really lost and down at the moment and if you would read on I wondered if anyone had any previous experience or advice.\nCutting a long story short - I\u2019ve been struggling with depression and OCD since I was about 15. It caused me to be anti-social and distant from everyone. I would especially feel like this in summer as I would never do anything because I was too mentally drained and depressed to care. \nHowever, recently (5 yrs later) I have gotten help and feel like I\u2019d like to start reconnecting with people. Here\u2019s where I\u2019d be grateful for some advice.\nI struggle to connect with my (once) closest friends now. I have no idea what to ask about to keep the convo flowing (this might be due to my self confidence of thinking no one wants to talk to me / I\u2019m annoying them) and escape the tedious \u201chow\u2019s everything\u201d convo. It gets me completely down and I relapse probably every 2 weeks into a full week of feeling so sad/lonely because I feel like I\u2019ve ruined my whole life. \nLast week I slept in till 6pm half of the week just because I had no feeling of self worth due to having no one to just chat to. I\u2019m not awkward or bad at making friends but I find it hard to reply to messages as I get the feeling no one will text back for some reason. \nI\u2019d love to reconnect and chat daily/weekly with my friends (we still hangout sometimes not completely distant and are a big group of 15 so not everyone I\u2019m super close with but civil/good friends) but unsure how to start the process as I always feel discouraged if I get the vibe I\u2019m unwanted as I truly hate myself. (I have also explained my mental state so many times and been given the \u201cwe are always here for you\u201d but I don\u2019t want to be the complainer so obviously I don\u2019t do this!

I have zero clue why the good times are avoiding me and it's confusing. I would have a date and it's either hurting me or not happening. I got distanced by my friends and I have nothing, but a father who hurts me with every word his mouth leaves. My mother is never around, trying to cope with her divorce and struggles by having fun on her own. I won't judge her, we talked about this a lot and I enable her, because I am beyond grateful for everything she did for me. Like she was my only parent who has actually done some parenting and raising in my life. My dad is rotten to the core abusing me physically and verbally, doing nothing a parent would do, but oppress me, like I am a slave who is a tool to use for pride and glory. Also he hurt my mother and now divorces my mother because he wants to cut her off from any financial benefits just to mess with her. My dating life is going nowhere. I had a girlfriend I didn't even love, I just tried to somehow get the heartbreak shoved away because I have other things going on. What my father says is catching up to me, he is wrong because I already am a better person by not following his footsteps and be a raging alcoholic. But the facts are facts. I am far behind my peers in many ways. My love life is trash, I am envious of them in a way that I am happy for them, but I can't shake off the bitter feeling I have. I just can't get myself a lover who can make me forget all my problems for the moment I am with her, because she is the only thing on my mind then. I never had friends while others are more connected than organized crime families. I always was alone and the only solution I had was solving it myself, because I can never rely on help, I am alone in this and no one will help and it's the way things are. I suffer while others succeed without any trouble. Others just have everything worked out and have a happy life. I just need to embrace that I am a failure, a nobody who maybe will have a decent job and an apartment, but I will end up with no one to actually motivate me to be extreme and awesome. I have so much to give, but no one to give it to. I can't afford a therapist, I can't digest and turn my mind off. I did nothing right. I have no purpose in life, I not only failed as a functioning person in society, by not having a girlfriend, no friend groups to hang out with, nothing but failure after failure. I should have been an Average Joe and have no unique thoughts, be a slave to fashion and trends, I swear to God I would be happier. I just hope I will be dead the next day. I wish I was never born since I was definietly an accident. I had a feeling none of this should have happened, but now I know why. I should have never existed. I am an error in the system. I wonder how better the world would be without me. I don't know how much I can hold on, but I plan to leave this horrible place and spare everyone from my hideous looks, my awfully odd taste and my annoying personality no one wants. I hope I die soon, because I am waste of life, taking the place away from potential doctors, lawyers and other important people who unlike me, are not disappointments",

It's little nothing done with good intention but I'm a mess, I already feel so worthless I don't want to be reminded of it everytime I speak to them...\nI do tell them maybe way more emotional than they should, that it hurts me, that their words stay in my mind for hours without leaving me alone...\nAnd they told me to stop taking everything so personally. \"Genius, I never thought of that!\"\nI know it's not easy for them either, I mean it's a family thing so I can be judgmental as well.\nBut it hurt so much.\nAs for the reason for my tears today: my parents decided to adopt a dog, I'm the only child still at home so they ask me to help find a name for him. It's the year of the U so I picked Ursus, I find it cute and my parents do too.\nWhen we annonce it on the family chat, one of my sisters responded by saying that it wasn't lucky to fall on the year of U. The others say that it was true but there were still other options. It's stupid as hell, but I was so happy for this little dog and that my Idea was liked by my parents. Hearing both my sisters implying that it was not a good name made me feel so bad.\nSo I tell them: \"I chose this name and we like it, don't be a ass about it\" \nOf course I was way to violent about it. And once again I was reply by \"stop caring so much\", \"we have the right to say out mind without being guilt trip or tell at\" \nAnd they are right.\nI want to respond to protect what little self love I have still left but my mom stops me, keep going will just make things worse. And I only have m'y family so I don't want that.\nBut now I am alone with nobody to listen and I feel stupid to cry over something like that but more than that I feel hurt.\nI wish I could care less, I wish I didn't begin to doubt how cute I find the name Ursus after all that, but I do and I h\u00e2te myself for that.",

I think the more you try to force yourself to be motivated, the more you just wanna lay around, at least that's how it works for me. Also, I think to begin to get motivated to get better, you have to believe that there is some hope that you will actually heal. Motivation has to come from hope, I'm not saying you have to wake up tomorrow and be the most faithful, hopeful person around but, I find it easier to be more hopeful that things are alright when I'm away from things that make me depressed.

Please delete if not \ud83d\udda4\nI\u2019m not sure what I hope to gain from writing here, advice, direction maybe, a sense of belonging - I\u2019m not sure, but I hope that writing it all down helps. Thanks in advance for reading.\nMy life feels utterly devoid of meaning. I say that not in a bleak, \u201cI want to end things\u201d way, but in the sense that I\u2019m just so completely numb and feel like I\u2019m just existing, going through the motions, putting one foot in front of the other and totally lost in life.\nSome backstory about me: I\u2019m 31, female and gay. I met the person I thought I would be with forever when I was 21, and we were in a relationship for 6 years. We owned a property, she proposed to me, and I lived near her family and friends - eventually drifting apart from the people I knew. She left me for someone else, which devastated me. I had to start all over again. \nAbout three months later I met someone else and we eventually moved in together. Our relationship lasted three years, was challenging due to the Covid lockdowns, and was very toxic. There was a lot of emotional abuse and manipulation. We broke up last year, and I\u2019ve had to start all over again for the second time. I now live alone in a tiny apartment with my cat, I know no one in the area and I\u2019m 200 miles away from my family.\nI have since started a relationship with someone I met online four years ago. This time I am very protective of myself, I won\u2019t be moving in with her any time soon and we are taking it slowly, seeing each other only once a week but texting and calling on and off all day, every day. One of the challenges is that she is on the spectrum (no hate towards people with ASD, I am also neurodivergent, but there are many communication difficulties that it brings, which have been very hard for us both).\nDespite my current relationship having good parts, 50% of the time we experience big personality clashes, arguments, bickering, and are completely polar opposite in terms of our interests and outlook on life. \nSome other challenges: over the years I have developed OCD (I have been through therapy and take SSRIs for it, it has now settled to a somewhat manageable state), and I was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago (again, I am on medication and have been seeing a psychiatrist every few months, recently discharged from their care but continuing with medication). I have racked up a lot of debt that I am slowly tackling with the support of my father, who is helping me learn to budget and be more responsible, but it does mean that despite earning a good income, I live a very frugal life with not much to show for the time and effort I put into my job, nor the salary I take home. \nI have a good career and I work hard. My job is my outlet. But when 5.30pm rolls around, I have nothing. Nothing but phone calls from my girlfriend and hours spent playing video games online with her. Recently I\u2019ve found those things aren\u2019t fulfilling me, I\u2019m not as engaged, I don\u2019t always look forward to seeing her or speaking to her like I should - which makes me feel guilty - and deep down I have the feeling that there is no future in our relationship. I find that so hard because I am desperate for a family one day, but my biological clock is ticking, and if I step away from it now I only have to start all over again - which I just cannot keep doing. Every time, it\u2019s like I lose part of myself. My passion and zest for life has dwindled so much over the years and I just feel empty. All the time. \nOn the outside, everything seems fine. I have a good job, I\u2019m quite attractive, I look healthy and I take care of myself. I have friends at work and I smile and laugh, I go to the pub with them sometimes and have fun. But I have no outside friendships - apart from one, however she lives 90 minutes away, and hanging out is difficult. I don\u2019t know anyone in my area and spend my work-from-home and off days completely alone. \nThe only joy in my life is having an alcoholic drink or smoking weed - both of which I do responsibly and moderately, regardless of your beliefs on the matter (I\u2019m talking a quick vape with a cup of tea in an evening, alone, with my cat. I\u2019m very low key and I would never want to jeopardise my work or independence - I would stop immediately if I were to have a family, that is my biggest goal in life). My girlfriend is a recovering cocaine addict though, so my lifestyle is a great source of conflict between us. Despite me never, ever doing anything around her, she has a huge problem with it, and I often feel guilty. \nWhen we argue recently, I have no emotion. For an easy life, I tend to just agree with her and promise to alter my behaviour, which I have, greatly. For example - I stopped smoking weed for three months to demonstrate I do not have an addiction and that it really isn\u2019t the be all and end all. However I find it fun, that it genuinely helps me with my mental health and well-being, and have imbibed recently. I tell her every time as honesty is imperative to a healthy relationship, but as I said, I\u2019d never do it around her nor put her in a triggering situation. \nI just don\u2019t know what I need to do to feel alive again. I fear that if I carry on as I am I will end up feeling continually more numb, and if I break up with my partner - who, on paper, is wonderful, caring, loyal, kind and attentive - I will be alone forever. I have no idea how to make friends as an adult, especially as I\u2019m quite nomadic, moving around a lot for work etc.\nI\u2019ve been through so much therapy for my OCD, I take meds, I read self-development books and practice mindfulness, I try to do crafts and writing, I open up to my limited friends and family - but nothing is helping. \nThank you again for reading.",

Menial jobs such as cleaning need experience and it pisses me off. Been stealing all my food for 2 years now, there is no hope and now I just wait on that day the police turn up to my door. When I go to prison I'm just gonna hang off the bed until I have a cardiac arrest. It's a shame because I'm so talented and poverty has completely destroyed my life and made my future non-existent. Was gonna join for the army but you need to buy stuff before hand, how am I supposed to get these things without a job? I can't get a job without them, how am I supposed to get work experience when I need a fucking job for that! It's crazy how retarded the system is, poor create the new poor, it truly is a fact. Been thinking of trying to pull off a big crime, had thoughts of robbing people and robbing shop tils. There's not much time left, in comfortable with death now, I used to have panic attacks about it so I've come very far, I fully understand and feel sorry for most criminals now, just misunderstood people who were failed and had nowhere else to turn.

Half of that self care and self improvement resources available online is pure bullshit to make even more money exploiting low self esteemed people. In my case, its not like I don't try but it works for me after a lot of tries, to the point it feels even terrible to accomplish something because others could achieve it way easier. I don't have a be happy mantra for this but I'll share the few things that I did that helped me change from my past self. \nThe statments are going to be very pessimistic sometimes but I am only saying it as it worked for me:\n\nOthers are smarter than you in a lot of activities, so they might be able to do it, with a higher efficiency than yours. But if you take a long time to do something, or bring a change that you had been planning to, it is gonna take a long time. Why even worry about time. Winners have lack of time, we are loosers. We definitely have time in our hands always as we are upto nothing in most of our lives. Why not just be a looser and bring changes in extended periods of time, even if it takes so. \nWe are stupid. It's not a joke anymore we definitely are stupid. It's not negative to claim someone is stupid, it atleast helps the person be self aware and NOT participate in tasks that involve social pressure, VOLUNTARILY, that too when there wasn't any need. But if we are stupid why the hell are we even sad about anything. Stupid people can't think. If we overthink, how are we stupid. Maybe it's not even stupidity, but we tend to be so absent minded almost everything we do turns out to be a failure. \nWe put blame on ourselves. Coz the absolute dog shit we are, the blame cannot be of anyone else's? But again, we judge ourselves way worse than someone else does to us. We are fucking loosers and may just be like it for the rest of our lives. Why not spare some blame on someone else as well, because even if we are dumb, atleast we should get credit for the things we did great. Saying this, since no one can constantly spoil anything continuously. Because that's like working the exact opposite of how it should be worked upon, again and again, forever. How does one even do it? It's not possible. There are definitely places where we do great. Let's just appreciate ourselves a bit before we rot of decomposing while people don't even visit our graves, because no one cares. But, ... Atleast we can? Sometimes? .........once in a while? \n\nThere are definitely more ways of how I see my current life. But none of them gonna help. I am not trying to solve anything. You vented your frustration as a post and I'm doing it as a comment.",

I have tried celebrating my birthdays with people, but it never works out. Planned a huge 16th bday party at a hall with a dj and such, 3 people showed and made it clear they came because their parents said to. They left the first chance they could and I was there embarrassed as the dj didnt even know what to do with almost no one there. My graduation and baby shower, no one showed. I tried to plan a 30th bday and reserved a VIP table. No one came, even when I was offering free drinks. Never had a party or get together since.\nNow in my 40's I have realized that I still have no friends. I have maybe 5 contacts in my phone. No one calls or texts. And if someonedoes, it is for a favor and then I dont hear from them again.\nI have a boyfriend of 12 years. We are not engaged or married and we have no kids together. I have a son in college from a previous relationship. I am taken advantage of and used as a convenience and bank. I pay for all the extras and rv etc. Even the dogs expenses. He splits rent/utilities and even then waits months to pay me. His friends and family hate me. So have not spent holidays or family events with them in years. His friend text him and told him how much the friends disliked me and i was using his phone when the text came through. His brother got married afew years back and planned a destination wedding. I didnt even know about it till 6 months later when we were at another wedding and someone asked if I was excited about going. I didnt know anything about it. So both my SO and his family never told me. I have not gone to a wedding with him since. If Iwas not good enough to go to his brothers then I wont go to his other families or friends weddings because he doesnt know as many people there.\nMy parents dont bother with me. My dad is okay, but my mother is toxic. She even told me to not ever have more kids(I only have 1)\nMy coworkers and boss dont like me. The boss now doesnt even assign me classes to teach even though i have workedthere for 12 years. She doesnt even email me back.\nI have tried looking for other jobs, but never get passed an interview.\nI have always been nice to people and will help people out. But always get stepped on or forgotten. Apparently I am just not likeable or worth it to anyone. I serve no reason or purpose to be here.",

 "text": "Was having another existential crisis thinking, thought to type it out, hope it helps(please ignore the spelling and grammatical mistakes) Life is temporary,so make the best out of it. The above sentence may be simple to understand but when it is used to apply, you may find it difficult. We have no control on the things that continue for example you are born as a boy or girl, sometimes we don't have choices to make but rather one's to accept and move forward. Waiting for something you want in the future is not useful because it will become wishful thinking. We mostly want to satisfy ourselves by doing things that we love but rather we should try to do things that help us improve towards success. Some are born in rich families,some are born in poor families, they don't have control over that, but they do have control over what to do for improvement. Whatever position in life we may be, we should always try to make the best of it. Being jealous of someone else, comparing life with others, expecting all the achievements, these thoughts lead us to be not contempt with life. Some people are having the time of their life and some are struggling, some are trying to get their daily bread while some are trying to heal themselves from injuries. Every person has a choice to make the simple steps towards improvement. As I said, some things are not in control, we have to accept that and move forward by improving us by doing kindness. Yes, we may be unlucky with the lives we have but all we have is now, the unlucky part of life where we struggle but we should accept it and should find the small gaps of happiness that we create. Honestly, from the time we are born we start to compete, crave to achievements, attention, acknowledgement but if you don't get that we push back and feel deprived of happiness. Looking at some perspectives might help, you might have a struggling life but comparing to someone else, you might have a better life and can do so much more to improve that and many things. We end up in difficult situations but how we move forward rather than looking back, being jealous or feeling that you are not receiving good parts of life, will always push us down. Some people don't jave fair life, sometimes life is cruel, sometimes people who don'y deserve great things achieve it and sometimes those who deserve it don't get it. As I said, we are not living a satisfying life but satisfying can be different from personal perspectives. A school boy might be hoping for some good luck in exam, but some other person who is not a school student might be looking for food. Making the best out of what we have is life. Life is unfair, you will be demoralized but accepting it and trying improve is life. Life is unfair, someone who deserves the best things might not get it, but should not quit on improving the quality of things we do for satisfaction. Make the best out of your situation is a must because you have no other option, either do something that makes your life a little bit better, don't refrain the situation you are in but rather create something that makes you happy. Whatever is the problem, you are in it and you cannot escape so try to work around it rather than running away from it. The more you are capable to work around problems and make better things out of the problems you have, the more efficient your life will be. Life is about the situation you have and how you will make the best out of it. Don't expect happiness, you have to create it.",

As well it is pretty affordable with work programs.\nThe day to day just feels so dreadful where I can't see myself being able to even focus or be committed enough to the work. It just feels like the responsibility and workload of any job is so dreadful. Like I have no motivation to do any work. I feel like some people would use hunger and shelter as the bare minimum for motivation to do the work they don't want to do. But I am the opposite. I am not there yet but I do see myself heading there. As the past couple of years I have found no value in anything, literally haven't bought anything outside of my bare minimum since I can't find work to justify whatever I am buying.

I'm not sure if this is the case with everyone, but it certainly is for me.\nI'm stuck at home with an abusive and manipulative parent. She has told me to my face that she doesn't care about my stress or my depression, and that my best isn't good enough. As soon as I get back on my feet I'm burning that bridge faster than a dry field in July.\nAnyway, I'm actually making progress despite her. I had given up on applying to jobs because after about 100 applications and zero callbacks I asked myself \"what's the point? I'll probably just be here forever until I die, either by my body failing under depression or by my own hand.\" I started applying again, though. I'm getting a little more traction so far. No callbacks just yet, but some emails saying \"you've made it to round 2\" or \"please complete the following assessment to be considered\" you know the type.\nI'm working on getting healthier too. I realized that no matter what happens, if I don't lose a lot of weight I'll be doomed. I've got a lot on my plate right now. My mother yells at me or belittles me almost on a daily basis if I don't do things for her, when she does basically nothing herself lol. I mean, I get it, I'm living here so I should pull my weight, but it's hard to do that when all I want to do is just...sleep, because then I'm not in pain. I'm trying to do the bare minimum things like showering, doing laundry, and keeping my room clean. But the stress of it all is too much to handle, especially when I'm constantly being told how lazy and awful I am by my mother. It's hard to do even the basic things I need to do for ME, let alone for her. But she doesn't care. She told me straight-up, multiple times.\nTruthfully, almost all of my problems right now would be solved with money. (This next part is political so if that's not your thing stop reading now.) I'm angry at the world for not having a UBI. If we did, I could have taken the time off work that I needed to recover from my depressive episode instead of basically being sucked into it for an entire year due to having to move back home. It's not my fault I'm depressed. At least I recognize that now; that kind of helps I guess.\nI'm poor, I literally have no money. In fact I can barely afford to keep open a bank account due to the monthly fees lmfao. What a dystopia. Anyway, I'm just trying to hang on. I hope I can find a job soon. Until then I'm stuck here with my mother, just constantly feeling like shit and wanting to kill myself. I never felt better than when I moved out for the first time. It solved so many of my problems. I just want to be free. It's not fair that I have to suffer because I don't have money. It's hard to keep a positive outlook when you know that you're one bad day away from living on the streets. I guess I should count myself lucky that I have somewhere to live for right now.\nI just want my freedom, man. I Just need money.",

I will sleep for 10 hrs, get up for 1-2 hrs.  Sleep for another 8hrs, get up for 1-2 hrs and then go back to bed and repeat.  \nAdmittedly I have no motivation for anything because I have gambled myself into poverty.

I have a boyfriend that loves me I\u2019m 19,young, supposed to be full of life, I have a best friend that would do anything for me. I have a good mother that works for our happiness. I have a home and my own space.  But everything is still so bad mentally. The world just feels depressing. I don\u2019t have a job rn and can\u2019t get the motivation to get a job for money for things I need. I have everything but nothing at the same time. Why can\u2019t I be happy, what\u2019s wrong with me being happy? The world is failing and everything is so expensive. Work sleep eat, work sleep eat, work sleep eat, I want to die. I want to live a life that isn\u2019t so depressing and filled with \u201cwell I gotta plan for the future so I can\u2019t be happy in this moment\u201d everything is filled with something to do that I don\u2019t want to do. I just want to relax. I just want to go out and be able to buy a drink without worrying if I\u2019ll have grocery money. All that seems appetizing is laying in bed rotting away. I hate myself and who I\u2019ve become. Children are so innocent and I regret not enjoying my childhood like I should\u2019ve. I regret so many things. I hate so many things about myself. I hate that everybody in the world feels like not enough. I\u2019ve never met a single person in my life that truly sees the point in living it\u2019s so sad. If nobody else can find a purpose why should I. I hope I don\u2019t wake up tomorrow. Everything is so overwhelming that I just feel numb. I feel so so numb and burnt out and sad with my life and I don\u2019t think anything will help. I feel like my purpose is to make others happy but why can\u2019t i be happy. Why can\u2019t someone do anything and everything for me like I do everyone else. I want to be better I want to be happy I just don\u2019t think happiness can actually be achieved",

 "text": "Breakdown I know i will regret writing this soon enough, but it's ok. I've been struggling with mental illness and mental health issues since a young age, where i lost the only person that loved me, my grandpa. After that i remember that i developed attention issues due to being constantly ignored by my parents, my friends, and my class. Right now I'm 20 years old, I'm taking antidepressants due to bad anxiety that used to cause me daily panic attacks at night, sometimes twice. I couldn't sleep more than one hour a night, so i take sleeping pills to treat it. I've been diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder and panic disorder. Despite all these illnesses, I'm trying hard to be a good person and not let them take over me. I'm trying to do the right things, as to be kind to others even when my bpd acts violently, take responsibility for what I've done cause i don't use my mental issues as an excuse. I constantly apologize for being angry, sad, depressed or worried for others. Even though I'm would say I'm a patient person and i can take responsibility for my actions, I've hit a dead end with my feelings. I feel like everything i feel is wrong, and that i should apologize for it, my every action causes me guilt, i can't help but think of what i will cause others to feel if i do this or that. I'm scared to speak freely, or act myself around my girlfriend or even my friends. I have explosive anger sometimes due to my bpd and i end up hurting my loved ones with words that at the time i can't control, as my mind feels like it's losing it's sanity. I guess i just wanted to vent that, cause I've never felt comfortable talking about it. I don't wanna use my mental issues as an excuse, but it's hard. It's hard on me sometimes due to my breakdowns. I have them almost daily, and i try to stay away from my loved ones, but I'm scared that they will leave me for having bpd, or that they will realize they deserve better. I know they do, they truly do. If anyone is ruining their lives it's me. I wish i could die. I've struggled with depression and self-harm for very long. It's been 10 years of me doing it. I've stopped it, but i really wanna go back to it. Well, that's all. I just wanted to feel heard for once. I didn't know where to post this. Thank you.",

 "text": "I'm the happiest I've ever been when with my husband but the most depressed I've been in years ... I honestly don't understand it. A little background - My relationship with my husband is healthy, but I had a rough childhood with abusive significant others alomg with other things that I'm fairly certain f*cked me up beyond repair. I work in a lab and primarily work independently. We have quadrants of lab benches and the other benches in my quadrant belong to scientists who are in meetings often so I'm alone with my head the majority of the day. I've been in this job for a while now, and listen to music/podcasts all day to keep my mind at bay and up until last week-ish, it's been working great. \nBut now I get to work and it's like my anxiety and depression kick into overdrive. As soon as I get home, though, I feel fine. But every day it has progressively gotten worse to the point of an anxiety attack yesterday (thankfully I had my emergency anxiety meds with me so no one at work seemed to notice). I don't know if it's my separation anxiety finding a new route of torment, or something else, but the overdrive is to the point of bringing up every traumatic event I've lived through, every mistake I've made, and situations I've realized I haven't made closure with.\nI don't know what I'm even looking for with this post. People with similar situations? What others are doing to cope with daily depression? It hasn't been this bad in years, probably since middle or high school. But all those times something had triggered it. That's not the case here. I can't pinpoint anything. I feel content with life other than the sht economy. I can't adequately provide to the extent I had promised to (on what used to be considered median income even 4-5 years ago) while my husband finishes college. He has offered to get an all-season job among other things but I've made it clear that I want him to finish out these last two semesters enjoying his college life and coacing as much as possible. It's just me. I had this idea of buying a home for us to build on and to buy him a truck before his car runs into the ground and whatnot, but this economy has sunk to absolute sht to where I can't do that.\nOkay I guess I can pinpoint the sh*tty economic situation we're in despite me having a stable income. I guess you just can't live in a one-income household comfortably anymore. I mean, I knew that, but to experience it right out of college isn't something I anticipated. But is financial instability really triggering my depression to this extent?? Or is my depression just that pissed that I'm finally healthy and the best version of myself?? I don't get it. Sorry, I know I've been ranting but I didn't know how to put it all into words until now.",

 "text": "Please share some advices about this My lover has clinical depression and its a secret he's been keeping from everyone including his family too. He shared his problem with me and no one else and probably doesn't expect any comfort or words of encouragement from me because I'm not capable of any of those other than sitting and listening to him, keeping him company. And although he says that he's okay with it and that it's alright, I know it's not, I feel usless and frustrated at myself for not being able to understand him and ease his pain. He's a lot older than I am and that adds more to my worries that I'm incapable of staying by his side, I love him regardless of the difference, regardless of the gap and it pains me to see him drowning in sadness. Although I know I can't wash his pain away in a flash, I at least want to know more about his condition and how I can help him in the slightest way possible so please teach me something about his condition and help me learn to understand him better.",

 "text": "Update #2 (cops were called) Parents stealing my meds Just wanted to thank you all again for the advice. This is a mentally exhausting battle. \nSo I woke up and texted my dad if we're all ready to talk. They were delaying this like crazy. I had to sit in their room for like an hour. Which made me believe that they're procrastinating the fight that were about to have. \nThat's exactly what happened. It started by me apologizing (I still don't believe I should be the one apologizing. But yknow)  my mom instantly started screaming at me again. Saying how I am a lunatic drug addict for fighting about my mail being open. I started screaming back. \nI started explaining to them the pain that I've been going through for years. And these meds actually helped me. They saved my life. They disagreed. Apparently they know how to read my mind for years or something.\nI eventually just got sick of it. There's no hope. So I just started demanding my meds back. They refused. Saying that me getting this angry about the mail situation is abnormal. Literally trying to say that I'm the one in the wrong for getting upset after asking them to stop opening my mail for the 12th time. \nThey refused to give me my meds. I kept demanding them back. Etc... I got sick of it and threatened to call the police. My mom screamed some more. I said something like \"these meds have saved me from suicide. And your choices are putting me back on that path of self destruction\". \nFor some reason, after I said that, she took it as a threat. And something that I can go to jail over? Then she started saying that she is going to call the police now. \nI got my coat, walked outside, and waited for them. Despite my immense pain from withdraw, I stayed calm. I explained everything to the police. \nThey somewhat agreed, somewhat didn't. I think they were just trying to keep an open mind. I kept showing them respect. Didn't freak out, etc.. Basically acting how I usually do when someone isn't literally threatening to take away the thing that saved my life. \nThe cops told my parents to give my meds back. They left. I walked in my house. Parents wanted to talk. They said \"you're an adult. We can't stop you\". Surprising that they say this, yet they still disagree with the mail argument and the meds I am taking. \nBasically in that talk, they basically kept disagreeing about the mail thing. They still think that the meds are making me a lunatic for not wanting them to open my mail. I told them multiple times to look from my perspective. If you ask someone to stop doing something, and they continue to do it for a year. Obviously they're going to get annoyed and fight about it more. \nBut no. Apparently I'm a crazy junkie for this. But luckily I got my medication back. I eventually just left the discussion and went to my room. Tomorrow I am going to get a safe for my meds. I am also getting a PO box.",

 "text": "I've lost my job, my home, my dog, and my girlfriend. I just need to know that things will start getting better. The last 6 months have been a trainwreck. I've been struggling with depression for a long time, but recently I feel it's taking all I have to just to survive. Midway through last year, I accepted that I'd have to leave a job I loved in an area I enjoyed living in because I couldn't find anything to feasibly rent. I had to move back to the Midwest, back in with my mother. While I'm grateful, I've been struggling with a lot of shame being here. I've been on my own since 18, so moving back in at 27 was never the plan. My girlfriend stayed with her parents halfway across the country due to medical issues preventing her from leaving the state. The only solace I had was in my dog, a 6 year old blue heeler who I adored. He was absolutely my best friend, the closest companion I've ever had. After about a month of being in the Midwest, he started having trouble pooping. I took him to the vet, assuming there was an obstruction, only to find that his body was riddled with tumors. The vet said it was the worst case they had ever seen. I was advised to put him down immediately, but I couldn't. I kept him alive for two more weeks before he stopped being able to function, and I had to put my best friend to sleep. It's been 4 months, I haven't been the same since. I can't do anything. My girlfriend and I split up tonight, after a rocky three year relationship. It's always been a struggle, but since losing my dog, I haven't had the energy to try to sustain it anymore. She was my best friend though, and really the only person I feel like I can relate to. We had similar interests and morals, but we fought frequently. I never wanted to lose her, but there was really no way to continue the relationship at this point. It ended in flames, so there's no way to salvage a friendship. All my friends are different people than they were when I left, I'm a different person. I'm not good at maintaining friendships, and since my dog died I've hardly spoken to anyone. I start my new job Monday, I've run my savings dry while wallowing. Its a labor intensive job, but the only thing I could really get in the small town I grew up in. I'm already dreading it. I'm telling myself that it's just to save up to do something else, but I don't even have a goal at this point. I feel like everything I've been striving for is just completely out of reach. I wanted to be a tattoo artist, I'm decent at art. But before I moved back to the Midwest, I lost my ipad that had my entire art portfolio on it, and since I've been back I just haven't done any art. Thinking about trying to find an apprenticeship just seems pointless. There aren't any good parlors around, and I don't think I'd be able to balance an apprenticeship while also having a job. I don't feel like I can do anything. I wanted to travel. I wanted to live outside of the midwest, outside of the US. I wanted to live near mountains. I got a degree in geology just so I could work in a mountain related field, but I was never able to find a job with it. It's too expensive everywhere to just start over somewhere else. I just feel like there's no where to go. I feel trapped. I feel sick. I just have no drive, no motivation. I don't want to kill myself, but I want to die. I just don't want to be here anymore. I'm so tired. I'm not taking care of myself. My body hurts. I'm always sad, anxious, stressed, and so, so tired.\nI didn't mean for the lengthy post. I feel like I didn't even express myself properly. My entire body feels like every nerve has been on fire for months. I miss my dog. I can't express how much I miss my dog. He was my reason for being alive. Every day that goes by, I feel like I'm leaving him further and further behind. There's no future where I'll get to see him again, and that reality is constantly on my mind. Getting a different dog would never be the same, but it would also be financially irresponsible with how difficult it is to find housing that allows pets. I just want to reach out for to my now ex, to do anything to make it work, but the relationship has drained me so much that I know thats not the right decision. I miss my dog. I already miss my best friend. I miss living next to the ocean, and I miss my old job. I miss having a drive. The area I'm in now is incredibly religious, to the point of bigotry, and I feel so out of place. I just don't know what to do. I feel so isolated. I don't know what to do, I don't want to do anything. I just need to know that it will get better, but I can't see how it could. I'm trying to tell myself to just work, save some money, and go from there. But without an achievable goal in mind, it feels pointless. I've always sustained myself with grand dreams of the future, but I don't even have those anymore. I'm just hollow. \nThank you for reading through this. I know it was long, I know it was all over the place, but I feel like I barely scratched the surface. I don't know where else to turn.",

It\u2019s great and all and I have a lot more freedom since my parents are not with me. But I still feel so depressed, like my mental health has not gotten any better despite greater living conditions. I should be grateful and I hate that sometimes I feel like the opposite. But The thing is I don\u2019t miss home as much as I thought I would. The problem that I have is I don\u2019t really know how to open up to people. I never tell anyone my problems or what\u2019s bothering me. I\u2019m struggling to handle my emotions so I just quietly cry myself to sleep at least once every 5 days. I have a boyfriend who I\u2019m comfortable talking to about everything but because I\u2019ve been busy with school and he has a new job I feel like I\u2019m just inconveniencing him. My sister said I could talk to her about these things but I really can\u2019t. We have a family history of mental illness (idk if thats a real thing but I believe it) I grew up coping with things on my own. Unlike my first born strong independet sister I\u2019m the middle child and for me, privately dealing with my own business and enduring by myself was enough. I hold most of it in so I end up having emotional breakdowns when it gets too much. I didn\u2019t get that much freedom before, I grew up quite guarded and I felt like I missed a lot of things in my childhood and early teens. And I feel poor with all my almost run down things but I can\u2019t get myself to buy new things because we had money problems before. I don\u2019t know where this post is going. I want to go to a therapist, but again I feel like that\u2019s just wasting my money. Everything is a mess lately. Small negative comments upset me. I feel like I\u2019m doing everything wrong. I hate myself.",

It mostly centers around a lot of regret in my past that I can't move on from, no matter how happy I am at times.\nI want to try therapy but I'm scared...I guess I don't know why I'm scared, I'm not afraid to talk about my issues with a therapist. Maybe my brain just doesn't want to get better?\nHas therapy helped you? What were the biggest challenges you had getting to therapy the first time?",

 "text": "I've tried therapy several times with two different therapists. In hindsight, the first therapist was just a privileged woman who got through life breezy and wanted to help people. Good for her, but she had no way to relate whatsoever and just kind of threw the \"I pity you\" cards. The other therapist genuinely understood, but I think I started therapy with the wrong intentions with her on the multiple occasions I tried to get better. My issue, personally, is that I don't have a goal if I do go to therapy to fix everything. Nothing that started everything. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression or as long as I can remember and just have been through hell in some parts of my life.\nIf you do decide to go to therapy, and they ask you what you want to focus on as an overall goal, think about it carefully because they'll center the entire treatment on that. Yeah, sessions will go into specific things that may relate generally to that overall thing, but just be aware that if you don't really understand where your struggles are coming from then they should probably be informed of that in order to properly help.\nAlso, at least for me, it was really draining. I don't have an issue talking about things otherwise I wouldn't have gone in the first place, but it still took a lot out of me to talk about certain things. I recommend scheduling appointments on your days off or toward the end of the day so you aren't pressured by school/work/other commitments to get back into reality. Give yourself time after sessions to decompress.",

Some days I have no will to even move and have to force myself to do anything at all, even feed myself and use the bathroom. Those are days where I have to be extra mindful and watch out for my thoughts because they get really dark really fast. This is what therapy helped me identify. For me, therapy wasn't a measure to fix me and make things better, it was tools for staying alive.\nMy doctor told me that managing expectations is pretty important, that for some people the best we can hope for is good management of a permanent, ongoing condition just like muscular dystrophy or diabetes. It doesn't go away but you can learn how to deal with it better. Just gotta fukkin ride it out sometimes so you can get to the good parts.\nOn days that I wake up feeling even halfway normal I look back at the previous days and wonder how it was I ever felt so down, I doubt myself and beat myself up wondering if I'm just faking it and all kinds of absurd thoughts that I won't let myself think this way anymore, that it would be the easiest thing in the world to simply not indulge such miserable thoughts and feelings... right up until it shifts again and I'm back in the darkness, just riding it out again until the next okay day.",

 "text": "Seriously, I came close to an early end several times in my teens and early 20s. But by the time I reached 25'ish. It gradually became so much easier to manage emotions, think rationally, control anger, and express myself more openly to a therapist. Also, the several partial hospitalization group sessions I did helped tremendously. Each was 6 hours a day, 4 days a week, in my local hospital. Wasn't mandated but voluntary. From that led to a med management person who dealt far more with depression/anxiety medications and treatment options. Instead of an appointment with a doctor or therapist every 3-6 weeks. It was anywhere from twice a week or up to bi-weekly. Constant med changes, and in less than a year, I had far better results than the past 15 years getting random prescriptions from doctors or therapists.\nBasically, I'm saying, wait. It does somehow get better. And as annoying and hard to believe, your mentality changes quite a bit in your 20s.  And if what you're doing atm isn't working, try something new, ask your doctor or therapist or even a the resource person at the hospital to direct you to someone that knows what options are available to you.\nWhile doing all that, try new things, look up your local group events and communities, or even see what hobby stores exist near you and go wander them and see what piques your interest.",

Most of my friends have gone on adventures, maybe married, maybe have a house; brothers have kids, homes, established careers; parents are now grandparents and are approaching 80.  Everyone has moved out of this town that I'm back in, except for one, but he has his own house and an illustrious past.  And here I am...same room I grew up in, no career, no illustrious past, many failures, emotionally immature, agoraphobic, uninteresting, afraid, bored, alone, not much to show for anything, aimless, bitter, tired, no hobbies, forgot what joy feels like, passions are dead or dying, disconnected from life...just, wow.  Obsessed with who I was, where I was, before I tripped.  I was surrounded by friends, a girlfriend, adventure, adventurous, funny, hard worker, no anxiety at all, so hopeful...and then, nothing.  25 years of failed attempts at jobs, love, self-discovery, adventures, happiness...fucking nothing.  \nOkay, mostly nothing.  I did get sober and, join a sober house.  I did become the house leader.  I did help a lot of people along the way.  I did make new friends.  I'm just...bored and disconnected due to significant mental health challenges.  And I'm torturing myself, by obsessively looking up the past...on r/nostalgia or r/90s or r/80s all day...rooting around my childhood house, digging up old pictures or trinkets.  Anything to remind me of how things were.  Anything other than the present.  There is no point to regret, is there?  Being back in my childhood environment, however, I'm constantly provoked.  I'm steeped in memories.  And my present situation is...depressing.  The only way out is through.  I need a damn compass...a map...to find my way forward, not back or sideways.  I can't change the past, and I certainly can't go back.  All I have is what is now.  And that will have to be enough.",

It sucks, it\u2019s unfair, but so is life. But for the longest time, I\u2019ve felt so much shame and embarrassment about my depression that I\u2019m terrified to express myself to others. I don\u2019t want people to know that I do experience depression regularly. I fear being judged and ridiculed for it. \nMaybe it\u2019s a generational thing, but when I was a kid, depression or sadness was not considered \u201ccool\u201d or glamorized in any way. You were told you were broken and should feel bad about yourself. That what society said anyway. But here\u2019s what I have to say about that: society can go fuck itself. It\u2019s okay to be sad. It\u2019s only human. It doesn\u2019t make you less of a person. When you consider all the pain and suffering in the world, I think you\u2019d have to be crazy not to be depressed. Sometimes I\u2019m convinced that hell is real, and we\u2019re living in it. Sure, there\u2019s some silver linings, and when I\u2019m feeling happy, I\u2019ll enjoy the moment. But I\u2019ve come to accept that my depression may never go away for good. And that\u2019s okay. What\u2019s more important is learning how to manage my depression. It doesn\u2019t make me a broken person that needs to be fixed. It doesn\u2019t mean I should feel bad about myself for experiencing a very human emotion. Maybe I am too emotional and sensitive. But I\u2019m human. Why the hell should I not be emotional? We\u2019re not robots. It\u2019s okay to feel depressed. Anybody that judges you for that can royally fuck themselves. Honestly, anyone who never gets depressed is either lying, stupid, crazy, or all of the above. Depression shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized like it is. You shouldn\u2019t have to feel ashamed or embarrassed about it. If you\u2019re feeling depressed, you shouldn\u2019t have to be afraid to say it. Depression makes us human. It\u2019s a part of human life, a part of the human condition. There\u2019s no reason to be ashamed of it.\nTL;DR: I\u2019ve bottled up my feelings for too long and it feels good to let them out.",

I know it\u2019s easier said than done. But these negative feelings are actually disguised as great teachers. They come up in consciousness so we can transmute them, if they get ignored for too long they build up in our bodies and cause disease and suffering & just keep reoccurring until we figure it out. Things happen that our out of our control, but we usually blame ourselves for it somehow & create all these narratives in our heads of why we are so worthless. But depression is a liar and the mean voice in your head is not you. That\u2019s why you gotta challenge the thoughts and make space for your emotions.",

Can you sneak off to one with the help of a friend? A friend's parents?

Bottling up your true emotions and pretending to be happy can be emotionally exhausting and may not be sustainable in the long run.\nIf you don't feel comfortable sharing your true emotions with others, you don't have to pretend to be happy. You can simply tell them that you're going through a tough time and appreciate their support. Being honest about your struggles can actually help strengthen your relationships with others and allow them to better understand and support you.\nRemember! It's okay to be not okay and seeking help when you need it is a sign of strength, not weakness.",

I was away from home, which made it worse as I am an international student; I went fully self-loathing for so long that it caused me depression. I'm slowly getting back on my feet with therapy and meds, and so far, I have improved.  I workout, but I lost so much muscle and weight during that time that I felt weak. I'm exercising again, but I still have a long way to go. I decided to tell my friends that I was going through a tough time, and maybe they would understand that I was struggling with life. To be honest, they are great friends, except something happened today.\nWe decided to try rock climbing, and I was excited to try it out. After all, exercise helps against depression. I was easily the worst when we began climbing and trying to challenge ourselves. I was fatigued and could barely climb, and I kept losing my grip. I was trembling, and the man I felt exhausted mentally and physically. Now I used to do five pull-ups, and now I can barely do one. They kept teasing me, and I wasn't upset, you know, it's just jokes between friends, but it got to a point where they continued laughing on and on. They said that I was weak and were like, \"yeah, we all had fun except you know who.\" one of them was like, you got issues and should check the doctor because you might have diabetes as I was shaking while barely holding on.\nOnly one of them was supportive and kept cheering me on that I could do it. They all could do it except me. They said that I came here and wasted my money because I could not climb. All of them knew I was going through depression. I just came back, and my self-esteem is lower than before. I thought they'd have my back and support me. Now I feel terrible and honestly hurt. I don't think they're bad people, but I'm not sure what to say or do. Any advice?",

They genuinely don\u2019t understand and try to deal with being mentally overtaxed, through bad humour or useless advice. Sadly, this crap is liable to happen again. \nThe best advice I can give, is sitting your friends down and having a serious discussion with them. Tell them that they hurt and discouraged you, at a time when you are already fighting like hell to stay above water. That you know they were trying to be jovial and funny, but they completely missed the mark. Ask them to please not do that again, as you need their love and support. Mocking doesn\u2019t help. \nHopefully, they will take you seriously, but I\u2019ve also broken off friendships with people, who kept bringing me down, rather than lifting me up.",

I know online advices say you gotta enjoy your own company, but idk how to do that. I've been made to feel stupid, unappreciated and worthless by both family and friends. I'm scared of someone new being nice to me because it reminds me of how my friends were at first until they revealed themselves. plus being locked up in the house most of the time isn't helping.\nI just wanna disappear from everyone's lives. is this like a curse or somethin? to be depressed. sometimes I feel like my life and relationships with people were long dead and I've just been clinging on  for too long. my brain is so foggy rn sorry if this doesn't make any sense.",

At this point I'm just hoping worse and worse stuff happen to me so I finally break through the numbness and feel something. Whenever something does happen it takes about four minutes to get desensitized and go back to feeling nothing. It feels like I just exist, doing the same things over and over. I don't like this.

Only my two closest friends and to a certain extent my mom and dad know how I'm struggling. It's been on/off for the past 10 years, so when I started getting worse again a couple of months ago, I finally built up the courage to be consistent in seeing my doctor about it. She finally referred me to a psychiatrist, and as of today there is only one week until my first appointment.\nIt has been very ambivalent, because on one hand it brings me relief and confirmation that something is wrong (we have public health care, so there are rules for getting a referral to a psychiatrist). On the other hand, I'm very anxious about what the future will bring and having to open up to a new stranger.\nBut it also means I've been able to open up to some of my other friends who I haven't opened up to before. I thought they would be understanding now that I have my doctors words for something being up, but most of my friends have responded with some variation of \"don't you think it's just normal sadness?\" or \"everyone have tough periods in their life\". One friend even said it after I had told her about my suicidal thoughts.\nI don't think I want to achieve anything with this post, I just wanted to let off a little steam.",

I've read that ADD is a mixed blessing, if you can learn to work with it. \nBut that didn't help the depression.

 "text": "You can have depression and make excellent grades. You can probably even force yourself to study when you really need to. If you have any choice in who you see as a psychiatrist, try to get a woman, who is more likely to listen to you and take you seriously (especially if you are a woman), and a younger woman is better than older. (These are generalizations, based on my experience and opinions, and there certainly are exceptions to \"my\" generalizations.) My mental health NP is a woman. \nI guess a little congratulation is in order for you making it that far through medical school. And for realizing that you have depression and accept that fact. Many people just drink their cares away, actually making their depression worse. One former doctor of mine told me that he's seen many people who drink heavy actually suffer from depression. Many of those whom he treated are no longer drinking at all now that they are on an antidepressant that works for them.\nYou probably already know that the usual way of finding an antidepressant that works for you is to try one type, then another, then another, until one is found that works, or works best, for you. I do highly recommend asking about the Effexor + Remeron (venlafaxine + mirtazapine) combination. The Effexor may cause a little weight loss, the Remeron may cause a little weight gain. When I took it many years ago, I had some fluid buildup, enough that I could feel it in my fingers. My wife had the same reaction. If that isn't tolerable, then Remeron may not be for you. The slight swelling of my fingers was enough at the time for me to switch to something else, but I think that may have gone away after I got used to it, so I really didn't give it enough of a chance. I'm on it now, at a higher dose, and I see no swelling or fluid retention.\nConsider specializing in mental health as a psychiatrist. Your insight to depression would help patients since you have some clue as to how they feel, how the world looks to them, etc. If you plan to become a GP, then taking more psychology courses and perhaps more pharmacology courses would help you help patients suffering from mental health issues after you become a doctor. And it  might help you understand yourself.\nUnderstanding that you have depression is part of the battle, and it helps you know that you're not crazy.\nIf you happen to have bipolar depression, where your mood swings up and down, treatment gets more complicated, so I hope you don't suffer from any form of that. If you did, you'd probably have noticed and mentioned it.\nTake care, and I hope you find a suitable treatment for your depression.",

Most people think major depression is just being sad over something, and they just tell you to cheer up or say something similar. They're not intending to be cruel, but it feels like they are. They don't understand. Especially about the suicidal thoughts. \nIf you can afford it, you might want to seek a mental health professional and pay cash, outside of the public health care system you're under. If you do, before you make an appointment, let them know your financial predicament and that your insurance won't cover the visit, and can they give you a big cash discount?\nIf that's not possible, start with your family doctor. See if he or she can help you, or at least help you get the needed referrals to a mental health care specialist. \nWhatever you do, please don't self-medicate with alcohol or street drugs. They may bring temporary relief, but they lead to more problems on top of what you have now.",

 "text": "Currently dating with someone who has severe depression and PTSD Hi guys! I\u2019m totally new here and I just wanted to be heard and lowkey, maybe ask for help. I don\u2019t really know at this point. I just want to apologize in advance if this post will be long or it will be difficult for some of you to read. Maybe i just wanted for someone to listen to to me. Maybe someone out there who\u2019s in the same position as me.\nI\u2019m (27F) in love with this person (28FTM) for almost 3 years now and we have our fair share of down moments in our relationship. He\u2019s been struggling with depression and used to go to therapy and had recently discovered that he also has PTSD. Even before we were official, he was very honest about his situation and despite all of that, I stayed and promised to love him no matter what. I knew all of his struggles, his demons, his awful past and how he would triumph over these and would sometimes spiral back down. I never left his side even at first, I don\u2019t know how to help and  it seems that everything I do to help him makes it even worse. And it pains me so much. So I try to learn \u2014 I listen to him and he helps me understand his situation. But there are just instances that our fights would get really bad. Simple arguments that would escalate to him hurting himself and blaming everything on him. Saying hurtful stuff that I should just leave him and I\u2019m too good for him \u2014 that he doesn\u2019t deserve me. These are the times that are most difficult to me. He would himself away from me to a point that I can\u2019t bring him back up. \nI\u2019m so scared that I don\u2019t even know what to respond because even if I do try to calm him down, he would find a way to twist my words and say things like \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m being such a burden for you\u201d \u201cFck me i should k** myself\u201d \u201cPlease hate me\u201d back at me. He wanted me to lash out at him too but I don\u2019t want to. I know that he didn\u2019t mean saying those things and I shouldn\u2019t take it personally. But during these breakdowns, I would find myself breaking down alongside with him, but I don\u2019t usually show it. I would always have to be the strong one which is not the case all of the time. I don\u2019t want to admit it to anyone but I\u2019m also slowly losing myself. I\u2019m trying my best not to blame myself for not being good enough or not knowing how to help. It got worse to a point that i\u2019m considering going to therapy too. But that\u2019s a different topic altogether. \nFor now, I\u2019m giving more time to calm down. I try my best not to give in to his hateful words. I would usually drop everything and go to him immediately but now, I have to also think of my well-being too. \nThank you to anyone who listened to me. I really appreciate your time.",

 "text": "Is it too much of a burden to tell close friends that you have semi-suicidal thoughts? Or more generally, how much is too much to burden your friends? Some real quick context here. I've had some pretty severe anxiety and depression for a while, but very luckily I have a close knit friend group that is very supportive and offers to listen to me rant/vent and tries to help. They've told me numerous times that if I ever feel deep in the trenches that I should reach out to them and talk.\nUnfortunately due to various circumstances my mental state has really deteriorated and I've been plagued with thoughts of \"wanting to die\". It's never been to a point of \"wanting to commit suicide\" but rather at the level of \"I wish someone would hit me with a car\".\nI recognize that these are pretty severe thoughts and I'm also slightly worried they may further expand in scope. That being said I've never vocalize these thoughts to anyone, but now I feel like I need to tell someone to feel less isolated inside of my thoughts.\nThat being said I'm worried about telling my friends, not that they won't worry or won't try and help, but because I don't want to burden them with something that, realistically, they cannot help fix. I don't want to become some sort of mental burden for these people that I care about.\nRealistically I should contact therapists and psychiatrists but due to my location, and timezone, getting in contact with them is unreliable, and the ones I can get in contact with may be not ideal either.\nSo is this something I should talk to my friend group about? Or should I instead just hold out for a bit longer and try and find a good mental health support later/when I can?",

 "text": "Deep in my mind Lately I've had a series of emotions, this sadness that overwhelms me. I can't seem to get rid of this huge void inside me. No matter how much I try I am never enough, each and everyday is a struggle. I try to stay positive but how can I when at the same time at the end of the day the people who bring me down are my own family. It's truly a struggle being the oldest everyone depends on me and it\u2019s so draining. I wish I could just run away but that would be selfish of me. I can\u2019t do that. Why is it that I have to be the one there for everyone and nobody is there when I need them. I can't speak up when it comes to me because my feelings aren\u2019t valid. It's not one bit fair. I get blamed for everything and my siblings make mistakes. It's not my fault that they do certain things. They each are their own individuals and I can't change that okay. But the one person that makes everything worthwhile . He makes me feel at peace when I am with him, I love him so dearly he\u2019s my everything he is kind, loving and caring. But it's just so hard to be me, it's not fair. I feel like I'm grabbing onto a huge rope and it's slowly slipping away and I don't know how much longer I can hold onto it. I am fully at peace when I am asleep. It's the only time I can get some peace of mind. My dad hates me and I hope I can be around for awhile I don\u2019t think I could ever actually kill myself I am to much of a pussy to do that. All I can do is lay in my bed and listen to music. I try to understand them but they are much too complicated and it seems that each time I speak for myself all I get is put down, I can\u2019t speak up my mind. I get threatened the moment Iopen my mouth. Today while at school at a soccer meeting my phone blew up from calls of my father and when I answered it I got lectured as to why I am not at my brother's meeting. I have other things,I have a life. I set up everything I went to his school a while back and got all the papers to send to the Academy that my parents want to enroll my bby brother. I wrote essays for him and fixed the grammatical errors. Put him first to make him look good. They missed the meeting. I get blamed for not being there but that's their job. Don't get me wrong I love my brother but I am not his mom I am his sister. This is one example of many, I\u2019ve given so much and none of what I do seems to be appreciated. I help them so much and they don't appreciate anything. It's so draining. I gave up my childhood for them and they don't realize that. I seem heartless but I am not. I am an ocean, a sea with a storm. I feel like I\u2019ll never be enough no matter how hard I try. I am not okay and I wished I could have someone save me from this. Some to open up to and be vulnerable but what if they use that against me. I can\u2019t let my gard down. I can't have people in my business. It's better if everything stays hidden behind my bedroom walls. If I keep my mouth shut, cry behind the closed door. I have to stay strong and work hard because if I don\u2019t all this pain won\u2019t be worth it. I need to make my pain and all my struggles worth it. I need to make my younger self proud . I can't let her down everything she went through. Man I am so fucked, theres so much about me that people don\u2019t know. Words kill. I wonder if I am the only girl whose mother calls a whore. A whore? Oh mom if only you knew\u2026 How deep those words you say kill me. I try to not let your mean commits get to me. Because I know I am not a whore. I try to not let those mean commits you and dad say to me. You ask me why I am always in such a bad mood. It's not that I am in a bad mood, it\u2019s just that I keep my resting bitch face so that you guys will leave me alone. I don\u2019t think I am well each and every time I get upset, mad, angry, sad my nose starts bleeding non stop, my head begins to hurt and the fact that I haven\u2019t gotten my period in over two months. No I am not pregnant I am just so overwhelmed my hairs have been falling out. I\u2019ve been overeating. I just can\u2019t help it\u2026. Eating in a way feels so comforting. I stuff myself and cry looking in the mirror, looking at my reflection and feeling sick to my stomach. I tend to throw up often, whether I mean to or not it just happens on its own. There's days when I can go days without eating and be perfectly fine\u2026 I won't lie, sometimes I just don\u2019t feel like eating so I dont I just drink water, chew gum or drink coffee and that's my meal. I really hope nobody else knows this feeling. I have all these things that are wrong with me and I just keep quiet. Why should I open up? It\u2019s not like someone can help me. I don\u2019t need anyone pitting me. I just gotta act like I am unbothered, focus on completing my assignments, graduate and leave this place my parents call my home\u2026 I\u2019ve been smoking and honestly it makes me feel good, I know it\u2019s not good for me but it helps me sleep. I need to get another pod. I just ran out and don\u2019t have any more. I hope I feel better with time and that I will be in a better place soon well mentally yk",

Couldn\u2019t sleep the other night and kept thinking of ways I could end my life. Everything just seems so meaningless, we all suffer so much and some days I just wish it all would end.\nI\u2019ve been going to therapy which has been helping temporarily, I think in the next session I need to be honest with him about how bad this is really getting. I thought about maybe trying anti-depressants to see if those would help. unfortunately I\u2019m also bipolar which if I\u2019m not mistaken can complicate the situation with taking medication. I was going to the gym and working out almost every day a few months ago, that seemed to help my mental health a lot and I know I need to get back into it.\nThe reason I haven\u2019t gone through with this is I know it will be devastating to my family and the few friends I still have. When I really think about it rationally, I know it\u2019s not worth it. This is hard to talk about but this community seems understanding, even to that level of depression. \nFor those of you who had suicidal thoughts but were able to overcome them and live a generally happy life, how did you do it? Any advice on how to get out of this mindset would be greatly appreciated",

 "text": "I'm so incredibly tired. I don't want to do anything all day besides sleeping, I feel like I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel so incredibly sad and hopeless. Hi, I (17F) am not doing the best right now. I'm a senior at high school, and right now I am incredibly burnt out.  It's not just senioritis, and I know this. I've been struggling with depression or depressive thoughts for a long time, and for the most part, I just powered my way through it. For context, my parents are very traditionalist and think therapy is scandalous. \nRight now, I feel like I'm at a tipping point. I really want to leave state but can only leave under my parents' conditions. Which is, I can leave if I am admitted to an ivy league or Stanford. It's so stressful because I'm also fighting a really complicated immigration status which leaves me as international for most college apps, making it so much more competitive for me esp since I'm asking for financial aid. I'm so scared and I don't want to stay in state anymore. I feel so depressed because they have crippling expectations on me, and believe me, I worked my butt off. \nOver the years, I did so much and always aimed to be the best for them. And now, after all these years, I can feel it coming crashing down. Right now I just feel so sad and unmotivated. My parents are overwhelmingly overprotective and won't really let me do anything unless they're hovering over me. They care a lot about reputation and always want me to speak or show off. For instance, we had a shouting match because I decided to NOT speak at the school open house (I didn't want to stay at school 'till 8 pm). They said that the school didn't pick me because I'm not smart enough, \nWhy? Well this freshman's parent spreads misinformation saying girls with 5.0 GPAS are picked to speak, even though getting a 5.0 overall is impossible at my school unless you took ALL AP/IB since 9th grade. I have a 5.0 for semester, but they don't believe that. Apparently someone from my school got admitted to MIT as well, according to the parent. Even though everyone would've known by now. This is causing me a lot of stress. My parents don't think I'm smart enough, and I know my dad \"joked\" multiple times that I'm not smart enough to get into any of the ivies. They won't even let me go to this program in Alaska even though they are covering all the fees (including travel) because it's too far, I'm a girl, and they're scared for some dumb reason (that I'm a girl and I'm oh-so fragile). \nThey always say that I'll feel the same when I become a parent. This is absolutely not true. I know I'll do the exact opposite. The amount of pressure they put on me turned into crippling depression and other hosts of mental health issues. A medical professional I managed to talk to said that I display neurotic behaviors and even my school administration is worried for me. I'm the resident \"crazy girl\" who's obsessed with colleges and doing the best and over-achieving who only drinks redbull and nearly faints. I'm so tired. I just feel worthless and dumb and I KNOW the ivies won't take me anyway. I  just don't know what to do besides rest. And I mean rest for a long long long long time.",

I\u2019m in community college right now and I\u2019ll be just fine. I think it sounds like you don\u2019t have anything going on but school and stress, so I suggest that you focus on other areas in life. Spending time with friends, family(if u have nice family members) and focus on ur health as well. These are all JUST AS important as school. Also u don\u2019t have to be out of the country to get away from your parents, tell them how you feel(or not if your relationship with them is that bad) and get away from them. Yeah it\u2019ll cost, but what\u2019s more important? How long can u really go on like this? Do u have a good social life? And how would you rate your health?",

 "text": "I honestly feel really stressed. I have a pretty good social life but it died down since I withdrew from people. I am really mentally unstable and I only really talk to one or two friends on a daily basis because I know I scare people away with my problems. For my grades, I literally exceeded the limit for getting the highest grades at my school, but my parents think it's not good enough because my overall isnt a \"5.0.\" I'm just so tired. If I wasn't doing well in school, then that's one thing. But I'm doing my best with life sucking and insane extracurriculars. Somehow that's not enough for them. I got into USC early action, and they won't let me go because they never heard of it. They care so much about prestige and bragging.   \nAs for other things like going out, I rarely do. They don't allow me to leave the house for extended periods unless they know where I am and what I'm doing at all times (and it has to be indoors). They'll only let me go if it's for educational purposes. I wanted to go to NYC by myself as my senior going away trip, and they said they'll come along because I'm a girl and its not safe for girls to travel by themselves (even though I wanted to go away fro like 4 days and I have a super close childhood friend and tons of family living there). They are insanely controlling, and honestly, I'd hate to say that this is them being loose. When I was younger, they monitored EVERYTHING. Now I at least get the peace of knowing they won't go through my phone all the time and I don't have to delete things I don't want them to see. I got to this point by setting boundaries with them. I know before, going anywhere without them was out of the question.   \nIt's a religious thing they use to justify why I can't do things. It honestly drove me away from religion. Even though I'm a good kid, it's never ever ever enough for them. As for other parts of my health, it's pretty shitty. I'm really tired all the time. Physically, I barely eat or I overeat. I always drink redbull or some sort of strong stimulant everyday, and I sleep for almost over 13 hours a day (afternoon + night combined). My parents also want me to always take care of my siblings and put the expectation that I have to educate them and do everything for them. They got mad when I said I won't write my sister's college essays when time comes (She's 9) and I'm not being a good sister for that. I have to educate my sister and tutor her on all the subjects, and I essentially mother them both (9 and 5) everyday. I'm really exhausted, and I try my best. Yet, the comparison game never ends. it's always \"this or that's daughter/son got this, got that, etc.\" I know they blew up on me for never getting a \"Presidential Award\" which is basically a piece of paper that schools order with Biden's signature and they award it to people. My school doesn't do that, but they got mad and thought I was lying because they saw their friend's kid getting it. They don't really believe anything I say and think I'm lying to help my bruised ego (when I have no reason to lie and I'm content with myself).   \nTo impress them, I've done research, become a student leader on the regional/national level, published WHOLE BOOKS, and am getting my writing featured on an international magazine. EVEN THEN, It's not good enough. I truly don't even feel anything at this point. I'm not even trying to humblebrag, just demonstrating the ridiculous lengths I went to as 14-17 year old just to IMPRESS them. I feel robbed of a childhood at this point. ..",

It really takes up lots of energy and motivation to finally decided to go out to the real world and work. \nSo, this is my third week being a barista at a boba shop, minimum wage with no tips. \nYes, I understand getting paid low isn\u2019t a reason to do bad. \nBut at first, no proper training was provided. They just threw me out there and expect I will just look at the recipes or ask other colleagues when have questions.\nBut this method doesn\u2019t work when it gets really busy. I felt that I am annoying everyone when I constantly ask question when they are busy. \nI really tried to learn. But I just couldn\u2019t be familiar with all the drinks like my coworkers. \nMy boss is pretty rude and has poor communication skill. Instructions are so unclear. 70% of the time I cannot understand what he is saying. One time, I put wrong thing in the drink, and I asked what should I do. He mumbles I thought he said just toss that. Then he said, \u201cthats money! I said just keep it like that why you threw that\u201d and makes me feel so dumb at that moment. \nHe is so unsatisfied with my performances. Constantly pointing out how bad I did. When I was washing utensils, he is like taping on my shoulders \u201coh can you just do faster\u201d. \nWhen I am just sorta taking a break and chit chat with my coworkers, he\u2019s like taping my shoulder again \u201chey did you clean up that trash?\u201d. \nHonestly I hate people touching me. Being my boss doesn\u2019t grant him rights to touch me without consent, right? But at that moment, I really don\u2019t have the energy to fight back for myself. \nI don\u2019t know am I taking all these too personal.

I got fired from my last job half a year ago.\nMy social life is pretty nonexistent. I had friends but gradually stopped talking to them. I don\u2019t talk to any of my cousins either. I\u2019m practically a recluse. I barely talk to my family these days. Not that I\u2019m in a bad mood all day. But the lack of a direction, goal or motivation is making me worried. I have interests. I read, watch movies, learn languages, dream of making art, visualise a good future where I\u2019m happy and productive. But future is built with efforts in the present. Here and now. And my lack of creativity and productivity brings me back to reality. \u2018Another day wasted\u2019.\nI know I\u2019m more privilidged than half the population on earth. Which makes me wonder if I\u2019m actually depressed or just lazy. That it\u2019s actually a lack of effort on my part and not real failure. Because, I look at people who are underprivileged and yet working their ass off and here I am just wasting my time with hobbies to give myself that little \u2018dopamine\u2019 and \u2018serotonin\u2019.\nI feel weak. I feel useless. I feel guilty. Like a misstep in the journey of evolution. Like a king in a democratic nation. Like a panda. Like a sloth.\nI\u2019m even scared of killing myself. I can\u2019t even gather courage to find a cliff and jump off of it. Not that I\u2019m scared of dying. How do I get out of my parents\u2019 house without making them suspicious? I haven\u2019t stepped foot outside alone in months. But the thought of not existing feels great so I might just do it.",

That's fair enough, sad for me but it is what it is. \nAnyway at the nightclub tried chatting to multiple women but not very good at it and no luck with getting a conversation going. I'm accepting more and more that I am ugly which sure look it is what it is.\nI feel like I'm doing what I can to cheer myself up but not working. Working on my health with therapy and going to the gym. Doing great academically getting Bs and As. Then lastly socially going put more and interacting with folk. Oh also recently been on antidepressants but that don't is doing nothing. \nWant to kill myself but I just can't which is annoying, would upset family. Wish I made my family hate me so I could off myself without guilt. Anyway just wanted to vent I guess but Christ do I hate myself.",

She gives me some fucking drug for people with BPD which I DONT EVEN HAVE. I feel like they don\u2019t realize I am not able to stand it much longer but they just keep pushing their anti depressives which I\u2019ve told them I hate the feeling of.

It's been getting worse and worse the last few months and I've lost all my friends. I only had two people I trusted, and it was really difficult for me to trust them. Today I feel like one of them betrayed me, even if he didn't actually do anything (precisely because he didn't do anything) and I'm afraid there will be no one I can trust again. I'll probably d!e before december. I wanted him to be at my funeral, but even if he goes, I'll never feel like he cares about me again.\nToday I saw him for the first time in two months. I've been feeling really bad all week, and the two weeks before, and I stopped texting him and the other person I trusted. I thought today he'd ask me if I was okay or comment on my disappearance, but he didn't talk to me. Not because he was avoiding me or ignoring me, he just talked to the other people who were there. I felt really unseen and like he had never cared about me as much as I thought he did, and that no one would care about me like I care about them.\nSo yeah. This is about him, and about dying without trusting anybody. I've been setting myself date goals to stay alive (\"you have to be alive when the new single by your favorite artist comes out\", etc), but right now my date goal was his birthday, and I no longer look forward to that date.",

 "text": "Penny for your thoughts I used to have a lot of friends in my early 20s. Over the years, as is common, they have dissipated and off doing their own things. The thing is, the people from my past, friends I've had for a very long time, well, they can't stand me. This isn't without reason.\nI'm turning 34 in June, and for years I battled drug and alcohol addiction. Until about the age of 25 it was all fun and games. I didn't realise how bad it was until I reached that age and knew how dependent I was. I have past traumas which I suppose made reality harder to cope with. But, to put it simply, over time I lost the love in my heart and became a vile, destructive, hateful alcoholic. Drug use was intermittent but drank most days a week. A lot, a sprinter, trying to reach loss of consciousness.\nThis continued and over the years people would have less and less interest in talking with me, being my friend. I just wasn't a very nice guy. I get it. \nAround the age of 30, a long time gf broke it off with me for my drinking. 6 or so years down the drain. Met some other bloke. Lied about it though, and I knew, exacerbating the hate and the angry feelings brewing inside. \nMoved back to my home city (gf and I lived in a country town together) and it wasn't until then that I realised how alone I was. Old friends, I'd felt abandoned. They weren't interested in me, and I talk this personally. When sober I could see that it was my behaviour when intoxicated however when intoxicated those angry feelings and feelings of abandonment caused me to destroy what remained of old connections. You can guess how this was done. Rude messages/phone calls etc. I had lost control. \nNow, 34 in the June as stated, and I'm sober. Looking back, I can see how sick I was. I never, ever felt happy. Not until I had a drink in my hand or was under the influence of something. Nothing but hate in my heart for everyone, Selfishly, feeling abandoned by the people I thought would always be there, despite realising just how bad I was.\nNowadays, sober, and i have a beautiful girl that loves me for who I am, and what I became when I changed my life, but I still have an extensive list of old friends that remember me for the person I was when I was unwell. I have tried time and time again to message and get my messages across that I am sorry, pleading my case, not expecting friendship but just acknowledgement that who I was, wasn't who I wanted to be. \nWell, despite heartfelt apologies, I haven't received a response and desperation has made me feel like I have become a big joke to all of them. In fact, some are connected, so I already know through a source they feel I'm that 'crazy guy'. \nI know that if the tables were reversed, if my mate abused me once while intoxicated, which he has before, I would give him 2 minutes to say his peace. Well, that's not the case here. And it isn't one. There are about 5 people from that time that simply won't respond or even check a message. \nIt feels rough, but i know it's a lesson I have had to learn the hard way. At times I feel paranoid that they all conspire and joke behind my back about how I'm a lunatic, which I know im not. \nI just find it saddening to know how people you think will always be there respond to you when you have a mental breakdown. This is what you get for years of friendship. I acknowledge that I was awful to be around, but is this fair?\nWhat do you think? Honestly, am I wrong for feeling that I deserved a bit more than total ignorance? It always hits more when you feel you don't even deserve acknowledgement on their behalf. Sigh. Anyway lol thanks to anyone willing to get through this novel.",

But I\u2019m really having a rough one today. \nOn Monday I decided to take a chance and start my own business. I\u2019ve been out of work for a couple months (long story), and a job opportunity I thought I had fell through. \nSo I told my closest friends about it, since they\u2019re aware of my struggles with mental health and now my financial struggles.   \nOut of like 8 people I consider friends, only 1 offered any words of encouragement. Most either ignored my texts (I\u2019m in a few group chats), one \u201cemphasized\u201d my text, and my best friend since high school (we\u2019re in our 40s now, so we go way back), said \u201ccool\u201d. \nThis is kind of a big deal. I\u2019ve never tried to do this before. I\u2019m terrified, but since Monday night when I made up my mind, I\u2019ve been excited! For the 1st time in years I\u2019m excited for something. I\u2019ve been studying all week. Looking at the market, watching YouTube videos trying to learn the ins and outs, and figuring out what equipment and materials I need. \nBut today, the lack of encouragement from these people I\u2019ve been friends with for years or decades in some cases, just wrecked my confidence. I\u2019m second guessing everything. I keep breaking down crying wondering what a fucking idiot like me is thinking about\u2026there\u2019s no way I can create and run a successful business. Just who do I think I am?! I\u2019m a fucking loser. Always have been, always will be. \nAnd I know that shits not even true, but my brain keeps telling me anyway.\nMan, I hope tomorrow is better. \nTake care, everyone! Please be kind to each other.

Its hit a point now where I genuinely feel nothing anymore, I find no enjoyment in games or shows or anything. I watched the first 3 episodes of the last of us and enjoyed it but now I just dont care about it anymore. I put it on and turn it off in a few minutes because I just can't get myself to care anymore. My family moved us to a new state so I have no friends here, can't go to school cuz money, dont drive, and am trying to find a job but dont know how ill ever get one because I smoke weed to help with sleep issues and depression so i would never pass a drug test. The only thing I do everyday is watch Youtube or make music. I'm making this post because now even that is starting to slip, I hate all the music I make. I feel like I've vastly overestimated how good I am, I fucking hate it all. I've completely separated myself from music now, im done. I've just been sitting here thinking what to do and I don't know, and getting to a therapist right now is not possible. I don't have anyone I can really spill this all to and its eating me from inside. All I think about now is that maybe ill get hit by a truck or die in my sleep, then all my problems would fade away. has anyone been here before, what do i do to get rid of this numbness? I just want to be happy again and im scared its to the point where i need meds and i cant get any anytime soon. sorry about the rant i just am at my breaking point",

As it builds up I never think much of it, but today scrolling through old pictures of my friends and I in high school really hit me.  Seeing the \"6 years ago\".  I think it's part of growing up.  When I was a teenager 6 years ago felt unfathomable since I changed so much every year.  But being a young adult and thinking that in 6 years, I haven't really changed at all.  I've been a depressed and anxious mess and arguably made my life worse over the past few years.  It really hit me.\nI just want to say that I hope we can all overcome our mental health battles.  I know there is a lot of good for us in this life, we were given a huge.obstacle but we can take control of our lives again.  Good luck everybody <3",

The last 7 months have been absolute hell though.  Last August, in a span of few weeks I got diagnosed with a rare stomach condition with no cure, as a side effect of one of my medications. It has left me mostly bedridden and disabled. Around the same time my girlfriend dumped me, and hid she that she left me for someone else, which I just found out last night. A week after that my aunt who I was close to died before I got to visit her. All of this in such a short time was hard to accept. I've struggled everyday with nausea, stomach pains, grief, loneliness, loss, and abandonment.  My depression has worsened so much and I feel very defeated by life. All of my dreams got shattered so quickly. I was so hopeful before this span that things were going to finally take a turn. My world has been so dark and I can't brighten it even though I try to. My coping mechanisms aren't helping like they used to. I've sobbed more in the last 7 months than the previous 25 years of my life. I'm waiting for a therapist appointment to open up. I wish I could get any relief quicker for this unbearable amount of pain.",

 "text": "Life in purgatory It's so exhausting to be a person. I'm a big introvert, like top 10% of introversion. I don't hate people they just exhaust me. It makes maintaining relationships a chore rather than natural. I kind of take my friends for granted in a practical sense. I never reach out, they reach out to me. I'm fortunate for that but I have no urge to talk to people. I came to the realization that most of life is relationships with people and I'm forced to do it. I want to meet people in real life but there doesn't seem to be a place in the real world for people to be...people. Everyone is chronically online and of they're not they stay with their friends and not branch out. There's no place for loners to meet each other.\nI don't like to work. If I work a job for too long I get depressed. I don't hate money or people who have it. I don't think people who work are suckers. I have little desire for material wealth, but if I had the choice between rich and poor I would choose rich every time. But money as a motivator? Meh. Right now I'm unemployed after I left a shitty job and I am much happier unemployed than working. My parents help me out a bit and I find ways to get money here and there. I only want money for necessity's sake. \nI have ADHD. I have trouble focusing on making and executing goals. Compounded with my low work ethic, I don't get anything done. I hop from goal to goal and complete nothing or forget. I'm a creative person but sticking to a skill to get good at feels impossible. When I do work on my creative work I criticize it to hell. I criticize the utility of it. I criticize everything.\nI'm prone to depression. I'm not even sure I experience happiness as much as others. For example, I like to draw. I know I do. But when I draw it feels like there is one molecule of dopamine and that's it. I have no urge to do it, I have to choose to do it. It often feels painful to do it and I often wonder if it's even worth doing.\nAm I missing something? Artists are drawn to their craft and even if they have problems too the work still gets done.\nI don't use drugs or drink anymore and that has helped. I eat better and take care of myself. But I still am in a pit.\nI often wonder if my brain is broken. I feel like I don't receive reward the same. I just live and suffer.\nI do love to laugh and joke around and play video games (video games are getting boring). I do feel happiness and enjoyment sometimes but day to day hobbies and such is a chore. It feels like I have to do them just to stay sane and not because I enjoy it.\nMy parents and friends say. \"Don't worry, everything will work out and you'll figure it out.\" Really? Will I? What if I don't? I haven't made many improvements and life is fast and short. I'm scared.\nI want to feel alive.\nThanks for reading.",

I started a medication it it brought my depression back a few months ago. Now my husband is divorcing me (for an unrelated reason) but he has always helped me cope and understand my emotions and how to unravel my bad thoughts. We\u2019ve been together 9 years and this week he told me he wants to divorce. He didn\u2019t warn me or try anything. He had asked me before over the years to change some things and I never put in the effort to do so. It\u2019s all my fault. I don\u2019t know how to cope with loosing the love of my life because I was such an idiot. I have always feared death. Suddenly I no longer do. I wouldn\u2019t actively attempt but it scares me that I\u2019m no longer scared. I am beyond depressed. Every morning I wake up and throw up and don\u2019t eat or drink until well into the afternoon. I\u2019ve lost 8 pounds in 4 days. I am lost. He was my life, my future, my love. How do I cope with the loss of my husband, my marriage, and my whole life knowing it was all my fault. The guilt is unbearable",

However, I don\u2019t think it is all your fault, it is extremely rare that only one person contributed to the breakup of a marriage. While you may not have made some changes he asked for, you shouldn\u2019t take the full burden. I think speaking with a grief counselor or someone in more detail can help you wade through the guilt you feel and understand the bigger picture where both parties are at fault in these things almost always.",

 "text": "I feel so weak at times (intoxicated vent) About 10 years ago (I was about 15) I noticed my mom's behavior/emotions change in the middle of the day. I knew something was wrong but did nothing about it. I noticed her drinking, which she never did. I remember thinking that there was something wrong but I did nothing, said nothing. I watched her cry and shake while I hugged her, assured her it was okay, and then left her alone to go play a game.\nLater that night I read both of her suicide notes to my brother and me. She asked if I saw her notebook and I lied and told her it was already closed. I laid in bed and listened to her try to drink herself to death while her friends tried to calm her down. I listened to my brother come home and try to get her to stop. I pretended to be asleep while the ambulance came to pick her up. I refused to go in the ambulance with them.\nThis seems to be a common point of regret I have in my life. Constantly trying to avoid any sort of conflict. I'd rather sit by and say nothing than have to have a serious conversation with somebody. I feel so weak at times. There are so many moments in my life where I should have spoken up, and told people how I was really feeling. My lowest points always fixate around the times I didn't tell people how I felt because I was scared. Especially my ex, even though it's been almost 7 years now.",

It really feels like I just have.. the weight of the whole world on my shoulders every day.\nI didn\u2019t have a great childhood. I was depressed once my mom left me, so I was adopted and raised by my grandparents. \nMy mother was a little abuse towards me as a child, and she had me at the age of 16.\nBecause of my sudden becoming, I didn\u2019t really have anyone to take care of me so I would have to go to daycares. \nI hated it. It was one of the first times my grandmother would write about my anxiety as a child. It\u2019s something I ignored growing up because I didn\u2019t get why I felt this way or what it was. \nUnfortunately.. in my experience with daycare I was exposed to sexual abuse at such a young age. Physical abuse, and sexual abuse was also present. As a child I didn\u2019t talk much, so I guess that\u2019s what made me an easy target. \nI feel like that\u2019s what was just stuck with me for years. It really has messed me up. Only recently it came to my attention once I was diagnosed with ptsd recently. I always really never understood why people made me so anxious, or why I was always hyper vigilant. \nIt\u2019s something I started doing to not get hurt again. I never told my grandmother about the stuff that happened to me in daycare, because at a young age.. I knew it would absolutely break her heart. I didn\u2019t want her to blame herself for it. It\u2019s not her faults anyways.\nIn addition, I didn\u2019t have it any easier in school. I got bullied a lot. It didn\u2019t feel like I fit in all the time. I didn\u2019t talk much but I did have a tiny group of friends. \nIt was also in highschool that I really had felt the start of the full force  of my depression. \nUnfortunately- during first semester of college, my ex girlfriend of a couple years cheated on me, and in addition sexually assaulted me. This is something I hid from alot of people. It really really drove me deeper into depression. That plus I was having a rough time my senior year of high school with depression and not knowing what I want to do in life. Or- well I thought I did. \nAs a kid I really loved art. I always had a thing for art. My grandmother was someone that would always encourage me to do whatever the hell I felt like, and she would support me through it. I would do gymnastics and rock climbing back then, but this all suddenly stopped for me one day. I just - didn\u2019t feel like anything anymore. I started to realize that I don\u2019t understand what it felt like to be happy. Or enjoy my life. Art.. was one of the few things that was always there for me. Along with video games. I\u2019m an only child so, being by myself was normal. I didn\u2019t talk really. But it isn\u2019t as if I don\u2019t have social skills. I just always feel so exhausted being in peoples presence. It just stresses me out, and I always felt uncomfortable around people. I just have body aches after just being around peoples, it\u2019s exhausting. So it didn\u2019t feel unusual. \nMy grandma was the one that started to notice, when I would just not eat. She would come talk to me and she would always make me some spaghetti. (Pasta is always a safe fav food of mine) my grandma just got me as a person. She was always kind to me and others. Everyone loved her, and I guess I looked up to her Ofc. She made me feel like a human being . Both her and my aunt. They were.. 2 sisters from different mothers basically. And they.. both died to cancer 3 and a half years ago. \nThey would make me feel.. like I was seen. It felt like they were real people. They always gave me warm hugs, that.. I feel like I don\u2019t remember the last  time I have been hugged. I\u2019ve been lonely without them. My entire life .. hasn\u2019t been the same since. That day I was looking at my aunt, dead in her coffin. \nI think.. when my grandma told me that she was diagnosed with cancer. I didn\u2019t want to believe it. I mean.. I didn\u2019t want to believe that she would be gone just like that. I watched both my grandma and my aunt just.. slowly wither away from cancer. Their smiles just.. slowly got weaker. They both got very skinny. \nTheir hair fell out. I watched as my grandma tried to not freak out infront of me as she noticed some clumps of hair were coming out this one particular day. She knew. She knew how much it hurt me  to see her like this. She just smiled and said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be healthy again\u201d I Knew she knew. I knew that she knew she wasn\u2019t going to make it, and she didn\u2019t want me to worry. But she knew that.. I\u2019m just like her. When she was near the end of her life.. she would ask my grandfather if I ate each day. \nTill.. that one Saturday afternoon. I went to wake her up. And I noticed that she didn\u2019t respond at all. I just.. stood there. It\u2019s as if the world just went completely silent. The house felt bigger. One less person really does.. make a house feel bigger somehow. I don\u2019t even remember the date she died. It was really traumatic for me I guess because.. I just barely remember  the funeral. It was just strange to me that all of her co workers would recognize me and tell me that she talked about me every day. I was just shocked because all I could think was .. me? I\u2019m not anything special ..it was my grandma who was the special one. \nShe was liked by everyone and they liked her cooking. But my grandma would always be there for me no matter what. She meant everything to me. I dropped out of college to help take care of her, and I couldn\u2019t even focus on school once my aunt died the year before. \nBoth my aunt and grandma were really supportive of me in school. They always praised me when I did good, and always told me to keep doing my best. They were at every single graduation, and important event. And they just.. both withered away from cancer. Ever since then I really and truly lost motivation for everything. I stopped taking care of myself even more when they both died. My eating habits haven\u2019t really gotten any better. The week after my grandmas funeral I just had so many nights, where I would just get drunk to try and numb the pain. One day I felt even worse than before so I made myself stop drinking lol.\nMy grandfather got diagnosed with cancer a year after my grandma died. So.. I\u2019m stuck taking care of him. Honestly.. it really does take a mental toll on me. My grandfather is a really difficult person to be around. He constantly talks about my grandmother, and it\u2019s really difficult for me to deal with the stress of just always having to relive her death. Some nights I get nightmares of finding her dead, or other old memories of losing her in dreams. \nIt just makes the pain feel heavier. I really do miss her. I always wished that I could have got cancer rather than either of them. They didn\u2019t need to die. And it\u2019s been hard dealing with my grandfather ever since. He changed  once she died, and his health has been deteriorating. I\u2019m always cleaning up messes after him, and he makes fun of my mental health at times. He always criticizes me for not finishing college, and he doesn\u2019t realize how I\u2019ve been doing throughout all this, and how difficult my mental health has been all my life. \nDepression really has been forever eating me up, and it\u2019s been at my neck for years. It took the things I enjoyed away from me. It feels like it has taken away my humanity, or my soul? I really and truly don\u2019t understand what it feels like to be happy. I feels strange that I don\u2019t understand this basic feeling. I would typically feel extremely low or just flat throughout my life. I always feel like I don\u2019t belong here, and I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. \nI often feel like I was born too early. My mom having me at 16 made me feel like I shouldn\u2019t be here, a mistake I guess. \nDepression took art away from me for so many years. It didn\u2019t really help that when I was growing up , my grandfather would always shit on me for being into art, and would always tell me that \u201cthese drawings  will get you nowhere.\u201d \nDepression, social anxiety, and  ptsd feel like they have been choking me to death all this time, and I don\u2019t know how much I have left in me. \nI feel like a failure. I dropped out of college, and I never had a job. I didn\u2019t understand my mental health as I grew up. I didn\u2019t realize that I\u2019m so .. incredibly damaged. I\u2019ve experienced so much evil in the world at such a young age, it has made me very hyper vigilant. I wish I could just be normal. \nI feel like my therapy and my medication just can\u2019t fix me. Every time I feel that my antidepressants wear off and I just feel that familiar feeling of my mood dropping heavily, it makes me lose hope. After trying a couple different medications it just worries me, that maybe I\u2019m so mentally ill there is no hope for me. I won\u2019t even be able to afford therapy after this month, and insurance doesn\u2019t help me with any of that. It just feels like everything just goes wrong for me my uncle won\u2019t be able to help me out with it anymore. I\u2019ve been doing therapy for a year now. I just don\u2019t even know what to do anymore. I just feel like I don\u2019t want to live, but I don\u2019t want to die. I don\u2019t want it to hurt, since it just feels like that\u2019s all I\u2019ve been feeling  my entire life. Just that pain and empty. I just really feel like I don\u2019t belong here. Maybe I\u2019m really not supposed to be here. \nIdk anymore. I just don\u2019t feel human I guess. I don\u2019t have any support or .. anyone that cares. I don\u2019t feel like I exist at all, or even feel like I should exist. Nobody listens to me. Every day is really hard to live. \nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

 "text": "I have depression, is this behavior a result of it or am I crazy? When i go on group calls, sometimes I go silent. Like. There will be things I want to say, then I don't say them. I interpret people's actions as being that they are upset that I'm not speaking, which is fair. But then I feel like that means they hate me, which makes talking harder. I stay on the call, and continue not speaking, because every time I'm going to speak it feels like they will think that \"oh so she could speak the whole time, she was just ignoring us.\" or \"oh she'll only speak when something important affecting her is happening\" and it makes it very hard to talk.\nThese are real thoughts that I believe even though I can tell they're escalating everything.\nThis happens even when we're trying to game and like you know ideally I'd be a part of that.",

I shouldn\u2019t be all the time or for everyone, but every now and then it would feel nice to not feel, well, alone.

 "text": "Anyone who knows the rudiments of suicide risk assessment understands that there's a major qualitative difference between suicidal ideation (which you have) and suicidal intent (which you don't).   Details vary by jurisdiction, but almost everywhere in the developed world, in order for it to be legal for anything to happen without your knowledge and consent, both of the following must be true:\n\nYou are committed to carrying out a plan to try and end your life in the very near future, the means to do it are available to you, and the plan has a high likelihood of lethality.\nYou are either unable or unwilling to comply with a safety plan to keep you from harming yourself.  \n\nSo even if you are fully open, you're not even close to the point where involuntary intervention could be relevant.  But you can be extra safe by stressing at the beginning that you have no suicidal intent, just ideation.  \nStacey Freedenthal, one of the pre-eminent authors and clinicians with specific expertise in suicide intervention, has published some helpful resource posts on this topic: \nhttps://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2014/05/01/letter/\nhttps://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/07/22/therapists-who-do-not-panic/\nhttps://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/04/14/fears-of-mental-hospital/",

 "text": "Right? The actual amount of work a human must do to live is impressive especially if you compare it to any other species on this planet. \nSure, every living being must play his role in their own life. They care for their families and work for their pack, queen or similar, but have you ever seen an animal having to worry if they can keep their family alive due to high rent prices or being psychological at the end because their parents and family is driving them into depression?\nLiving in the wild is hard and we as the humans have it comfortably not having to worry about hunting, fishing, and forging but is it actually better for us this way? The constant stress put on us from society, the worries this evolved lifestyle brings with it, has it made things worse than they where before? Don\u2019t get me wrong here, I appreciate the health care, technology, and supermarkets. I wouldn\u2019t want to live without them but the way we exist is not the nonplus ultra, we must evolve further. I can\u00b4t deal with being oppressed by other anymore and I don\u2019t want my children to have to deal with this. The way we are constantly told how to live our lives, by our family, by social media, by society, by school and I could go on for ages, is not right. We should be able to live our lives in a way that makes us happy as individuals. I am sick of living only for the sake of others and it is driving me insane, slowly but it does. And if we where to talk up we where the bad person, the ones doing wrong, because how could we not care about our family, how could we not care about the others. But that we are breaking apart is insignificant, as it only affects us and not the others around us. Whereas doing what we want and what makes us happy would have an actual impact on them. But if you are exhausted and can\u2019t, go on anymore, that is your fault. \u201cYou have such a good life. Look at others they have it worse. Be grateful!\u201d. As if I didn\u2019t try to appreciate it, but how could one if it doesn\u2019t feel right\u2026If it makes you unhappy? \nI drifted away from what I started to talk about, but I think this is as important to note, so I will post it anyway. \nDo what makes you happy and not the people around you. It is hard but I believe in you. Take care of yourself. You are worth it.",

I couldn't even eat because my anxiety would take control of my stomach and basically everything would give me stomach aches. I had started to go to therapy and it kinda helped. Starting this new semester, I was feeling way better. I could eat normal stuff again and my overthinking was way less. I was starting to feel in control of myself and of my life. Now we are in March and I feel totally hopeless again. I barely have any strength to get up in the mornings, I lost my motivation and excitement for most things I loved and for my major( which I know I love but I just feel numb about it). Apart from all of that, my overthinking is getting the best of me and I can't control it anymore. I'm crying myself to sleep half of the week and I assume that the person that cares the most about me really doesn't and that everything he says about being my best friend and caring for me is all bullshit and I end up spiraling and getting mad at him really easily. I just wanna take control of my life again and not hurt my best friend with my overthinking. I went to therapy again but it didn't help. I also tried working out but it doesn't seem to help much either. Please, I really need advice on how to control myself, I wanna be better",

 "text": "TLDR: realized self worth and that people don't think as much about me than I thought they do, also cut off my energy draining mother\nI had depression as a teenager. I thought of ending it completely but the thought of my dog not understanding it and being without me kept me where I was. I struggled through, still being miserable, always insecure, always brushed aside when others were talking, they would just start talking, when I already was, always worrying about what others would think (my mother did this a lot), bad grades at school, having to repeat one year.\nThen, I don't know how, I started to realize others don't think as much about me. They may think I'm weird but that does not change anything I think about me. And there will be people who like me for being who I am. Not that many, I never had a real circle of friends, but a handful of chosen ones who are as \"weird\" as me. I have my best friend for 18 years now. We sometimes do not talk for months but it is always like we saw each other last week.\nI was okay for a few years. And then it came back for different reasons.\nI just recently realized even though I always told my mother that my childhood was okay (she was an alcoholic) and even though she apologized, my experiences don't just go away. And currently I am at the point where I don't know if I really and honestly can forgive her what has happened. I always thought I have to because I feared she might relapse and I wanted to be good. But I've cut her out of my life as she was getting more clingy and made me responsible for her wellbeing in January and weirdly I am feeling much better.\nWe had not talked for two weeks and she was annoyed and hurt and saw her therapist about it and told me to \"never do that again\". That's when I realized she cared more about herself than she does really about me. She is not interested in what I am interested, she does not even try to understand or show interest. She wants to help but is no help at all, judging me silently. But I noticed.\nAnd when I told her in January that I got diagnosed with a chronic disease (I was literally just put of the doctor's office) she also has (probably hereditary) and got laid off at work, she seemed concerned for five minutes, then needed to tell me she was seeing someone new. Then she told me she had wanted to end her long-term relationship for 10 years but did not as she thought it would hurt her partner. I got so angry because this was totally selfish because now, after all in all 12 years (during which he cared for her and did everything for her and her medical issues, being available for her call 24/7), it hurt him even more. I realized a self-absorbed person like that just drains my energy and cut her off. I don't know if she relapsed (she sent emoticons to my partner which was very weird) but I really don't care. And I am better without this drama.",

From the different accounts that I have read or heard over the years, sometimes finding a right fit for a therapist makes all the difference. \nAt times everything really sucks even for those who don't have depression.

Maybe sadness is this deep undercurrent in the state of reality that sometimes pulls you under and you just have to learn to swim with it till you resurface. Maybe some of us are born with it being an intrinsic part of our DNA. Maybe some of us just feel things more intensely than others do. I don't know.

The person taking it has to do the work themselves...whatever the word \"work\" means to them and to their situation. I am sorry it's been so difficult for you. Have you shared these feelings of helplessness and that therapy might not be working for you with your therapist? Maybe they'll suggest a different approach (they are uniquely positioned to help their patients find the right method) or maybe you'll realize through their response that you need to find someone else? \nI found...acceptance. My situation isn't exactly like yours. I had to finally acknowledge that it's not going to leave me...my despair. And since I had only learned to repress or deny its existence in front of other ppl so they don't feel bad and did so from a very young age, eventually acknowledging its permanence helped enormously.\nI think I'm mostly happy and sometimes really sad because I feel too deeply. And because I've found that most ppl don't get it, I kind of like being on my own. But you can find your own way through your pain. My suggestion would be to not force it... I don't think any positive change can happen overnight. I know that's a dark thought but I have found taking things one day at a time to be a really good advice.",

I would glad do the work if somebody would say what to do but apparently therapists in general take a stance against saying anything in a concise or definitive manner. \nI've told my therapist i would perfer if he was blunt and to the point but he's not doing that. Is there any therapists that are to the point?\nThank you for telling your situation. Mind telling me your process on reaching acceptance? Or was repression your answer?\nI'm just think therapy may not be for me if everything is like this though.",

 "text": "I cant stop fantasizing about taking my own life I've been diagnosed with PTSD and bi-polar disorder and all the things that come with them. Recently I left my X-wife because she had cheated on me twice in one week. We have a son together and had been together from the age of 14, up to 24. I live two hours from her and my son, because after we split she went back to live with her parents, I told her to leave our son with me but she wasn't to keen on that. After she left, I had lost my job, Had my wallet with my drivers license in it stolen, and my car because she took it in the divorce. I had to make money doing Uber Eats on a bicycle to cover the cost of a new birth certificate since mine is with my mother who does not speak to me, because of a falling out involving my X's dad, and my mother. after that, I had to continue to Uber to get my new license, all while doing this I could only contact my son via phone call because she refused to bring him to me and told me I had to find a way to pick him up myself, which in our area and distance was not achievable for me in my situation. once I got my new ID though, I landed a job as a sales councilor for fitness international at an LA fitness in Portland Oregon. Now I was making money and starting to garner a foundation in which I could begin to raise my child. I was constantly being verbally barraged, being told things like \"your a deadbeat, you don't see your son, he never gets to go to your place, I never get a break\" etc. etc. etc. \nI was offered a promotion two months at my job to become the sales manager of my own location. We have a daycare at my work mind you, and I was given permission by my work to let my son use the facility while I'm on the clock so I didn't have to fork out money for a babysitter and i could have my son for long periods of time, since our original agreement was I was stable,was to swap every other week. Now I'm making big boy money, I have child care taken care of for when I'm working, AND I bought a brand new car. I have everything I need to make sure I can take care of my son. I work 6 1\\2 days a week every single week, and I still made sure that I was capable and mentally prepared to take care of my son. After I all of this comes to fruition, she tells me that I'm not involved enough and she doesn't think I'm ready to take care of him, and I have to prove to her that I want to be in his life. I've been restricted to supervised, 1 hour visits, and none of this is court ordered. There are times where I get too busy at work and i can't always call him, but he's under two years old, so i don't think its making that much of a difference, plus i've said to her before I would rather just spend physical time with him because I can at least pop in our daycare center and check on him and spend time with him at home. \nThe other day she sent me a text, and it was very direct and aggressive, told me I'm a burden to her and our child, that I'm a waste of human skin, that there's a reason my parents hate me and how I only care about myself and how I'm lazy. All of this, with the stress from my job, the limited time I get outside my job, The effort of starting from nothing to something so that I can raise my son, has built up, and I feel like I've accomplished nothing. I feel like I'm doing all this for my son, in return to be shit on, given further stipulations that aren't court ordered, and verbally abused and never get anywhere. My son is my life, the reason I even cared to make a comeback in my life in the first place, and I'm made to feel like I don't care about him and told that he's better off without me, and I'm a dad whos actually trying. \nI barley sleep, I barley eat, all I do is work, and stare at the ceiling wishing I could just have an aneurism or a heart attack so my death doesn't look like it was on purpose. I make more jokes about killing myself as a cry for help, but I've always had an edgy sense of humor, so I don't think people think anything of it. I cry myself to sleep in the dark hoping i can muster up the courage to jump out of my apartment window or veer into oncoming traffic, because if I don't have my son, I really have no purpose to be alive. Every waking second I'm happy,cheery,and positive on the outside, but that's simply a way to hide from my peers that inside I'm constantly thinking about ending my life. I'm not talking about in a sad manner either, I get tactical, I plan, and come up with ways that are crafty and logical. It's almost soothing for me to think about it because the mental thought is like a sample of what I could really have.  I yearn to escape all of this stress and pointless effort when I'm not making any progress towards being a father. I WANT to be in my sons life, but I'm painted as a deadbeat. \nI appreciate you if you read all this. I'm not sure how to overcome this feeling, and each day it gets more and more intense, and almost like it gets easier and easier to step to that final ledge. She said my son would be better without me and I want what's best for my son right? I can't take it anymore, and I want to close my eyes and never open them. I want to inhale, and never exhale. I want to deteriorate rapidly from the inside out, and rot like the piece of dog shit I supposedly am.",

They've always just blindly opened the mail at the end of the day because any and all mail used to only be theirs. They apparently still see me as a kid who doesn't get mail often. \nHe then proceeded to claim that he is still unsure if I should get my meds back because of the way I originally acted. Apparently he can't see that someone would push the issue after months and months of them politely asking not to invade their privacy. \nI told him to look at it from literally anyone else's point of view. If someone else was opening their mail, you ask them to respect their privacy, and they continue to open their mail anyways. Seems to me that anyone would push the issue more at that point. But no. Apparently getting angry after a literal year of them not respecting my privacy is absolutely insane and I need to quit these meds that are supposedly making me go crazy. I feel that I was actually too lenient. I should've pushed back sooner. \nWell he had no valid rebuttal after I said that. Yet he is still debating giving my meds back. I have yet to talk to my mom. She is playing the silent game. She will be the hardest to convince. Even if I have every valid argument laid out on a silver platter, she will still come up with some bullshit excuse and turn it around on me. \nWe will see what happens tonight. If she refuses to give my meds, I am debating just straight up calling the police. This is absolutely ridiculous and childish. I am the crazy drug addict for simply asking them to respect my privacy? Fuck that. I am an adult. I have rights. If they continue to open my mail and take my medication, a literal controlled substance, idk how the fuck they don't get it.",

A big problem of a heathbreak often is overthinking and it gets realy dangerous when these thoughts are building up on certaint/spific situations, that youve been in with this person.

I feel betrayed and unwanted. \nMy ex broke up with me a few months back and blamed me for everything. It kicked me into gear, dumping everything and focus on my mental health. I know the break up wasn\u2019t 100% my fault but I did have a part in it and I\u2019m trying to fix my issues. Im getting professional help, doing all the things people recommend after a break up (journaling, working out, yoga, meditation, self-care, etc). Overall I\u2019m making huge progress and I feel like a better person. I know if I continue down this path, I will be the person I was always meant to be. \nI can\u2019t help to shake off the feeling of being unwanted and unloved. During the break up, my ex made me feel like this monster, this terrible person and I don\u2019t even know what was real or fake. I don\u2019t know how long she was dishonest and I don\u2019t even know if she truly loved me anymore. I have this emotion sitting in my chest and stomach. It feels like a few bricks and it just lingers. I\u2019ve been getting into mindfulness and meditation so I know how to feel the emotions come and go, but this particular emotion stays. It doesn\u2019t leave me. It makes me want to lay in bed, not do anything. It makes me want to just stay still. I don\u2019t eat anything when I feel this emotion. It stays for hours and sometimes days like recently. I don\u2019t know what this is and I don\u2019t know how to handle it. True thoughts of suicide enter my head. I\u2019ve made plans and sometimes I want to follow through. \nMy family isn\u2019t there for me. I recently had to cut family members out of my life for disrespecting my boundaries and honestly we never had a good relationship. I\u2019ve been digging into my past trauma as I focus on healing my mental health and I think that\u2019s effecting this feeling too. I don\u2019t have many friends and the one friend I go to, is out of commission until the end of this month. I dont know what I\u2019m looking for writing this out.

I usually would get a depressed episode once every month but for the past month and this month, its been happening three times weekly, and I just don't know what changed, well I mean I know what's changed but you know I thought I had it under control and gloss over it as usual, but I guess my mind and body are just saying nope not anymore suffer more in trying to hide your dejection, and the worse thing is not a single family member knows I have depression they just think I get pouty or mad at random times then proceed to tell me to stop acting like that and get myself together. The reason I haven't told a single family member is due to the fact they don't believe in depression, they just brush it off and make it as if you're being dramatic. Really don't want to tell anyone but with how my episodes are getting SO frequent its probably best, right...?",

Everytime I'm sitting lying still  this eerie feeling creeps up on me. I can feel it crawling up my arms, my legs and eventually reaches my heart and my heart starts pounding. I try to distract myself but it does not work. I went to the doctor yesterday and got prescribed antidepressants (amitriptyline) and diazepam. This is the first time I have taken these medications and I don't think it's working. I say this because I'm still feeling miserable. I still feel lonely, and empty inside. I feel like I got something heavy on my mind. \nI think part of my issue is that I have a person that I like very much and she is going through this too. I worry about her. I care about her well-being. She seems distant nowadays and that kills me. I don't want her to leave. It scares me.\nI don't know what to do anymore.

I met up with a car accident (major one, almost cost 1/10th of the price of a mid range sedan which ofcourse went on insurance, but another 1/10th of it insurance company didn't approve)\nAccident number 2: I fell down boarding a train which just started moving and I'm wounded (both legs and clothes torn)\nDespite this, my girlfriend also broke up with me saying that \" long distance isn't working and we'll be close friends.\"\nDo people really care about anyone?\nIf they don't care about me, why am I going head over heels putting in so much effort and trying to help out the society.\nI really wish I had someone to talk to at these bad times. I mean, no one would even listen to me talk about this.\nIf you have read this till here, thank you for reading and i should love to have you as my social support.

I was taking Wellbutrin when I was a freshman in high school. I stopped in my '20s because I'm an idiot. Then about 6 years ago, in my early thirties I started taking bupropion again.\nThe reason why I stopped recently was because I got some helpful advice on an IBS subreddit about how certain types of antidepressants can help I be a symptoms. But he can't take bupropion and amitriptyline at the same time, so I wanted to detox off the old one before I start the new one.\nThe new one didn't work out for me didn't like the side effects. Give up after 2 days.\nSo now it's been about 3 weeks, maybe a month, since I've taken bupropion. And I think I'm noticing some relief with my IBS symptoms.\nStarting to wonder if my boo boo Brian was making my IBS worse. I've had IBS for as long as I can remember. But I've also been taking these meds for most of my life. I do know that the meds aren't the cause of my IBS, but I'm starting to believe that they may have been causing me to have a hypersensitivity to its symptoms.\nMakes sense.\nFor the same reason that amitriptyline was supposed to help. And I depressants effect the neurotransmitters in the brain. There is a very strong gut-brain connection when it comes to IBS. It's possible that boopopreon works in a way that heightens every gut tremor and gurgle and sensations of bloating and everything else.\nAnd considering that IBS is one of the biggest reasons why I feel I need depression medication. I'm starting to wonder if I should go back on the meds at all.\nFor those of you have been taking medications most of your life. How do you feel about the side effects? Which medications are you taking? Bigger question is, how do you know who you are? How much of you is you and how much of you is the meds?",

Not a mental illness, just a lazy girl who wants to blame something else for all the things that need doing. I know I'm not alone in this feeling, and by comparison my depression is fairly mild.

I\u2019m also in a wheelchair due to a scoliosis correction surgery gone awry. \nSo to try and keep this short I\u2019ll explain my problem now, and provide extra details if/when asked. Lately, I just feel like shit. Back in 2021 I was sick nearly the entire year and thought I was going to end up getting diagnosed with some kind of bone cancer. I have a girlfriend, 25f, that I\u2019ve been with for 5 years in a long distance relationship. She lives in Australia and I live in America. We met back in the beginning of our relationship but then Covid hit and we couldn\u2019t see one another. At that time I had a job but because I kept getting sick I had to quit and I\u2019ve been living off of SSI since. That was like 2 years ago. I was in college and I had to drop out because of mental stress coupled with living with my parents who I\u2019ve tried to come out too multiple times but the conversation never ends well. In the past they would just take me to church with them more and say \u201cwe need to spend more time together as a family.\u201d Because they think that me being trans means they don\u2019t love me enough or something. I haven\u2019t told them that I\u2019ve dropped out of college and I have 5 months to either tell them the truth or get really good at degree forgery. My mom is prior military so not going to college will piss her off. This is my third attempt at college and if I\u2019m being honest I think I was just too terrified to let the family down again. That and, if I don\u2019t stay in college then my parents have to pay out of pocket for my healthcare and can\u2019t afford that because my mother is the only one working in the house.\nThe other night me and my girlfriend had a talk and she helped me navigate some of these feelings but the thing that\u2019s fucking with me is mainly the fact that, I have no job. I\u2019m only getting chump change from the government. I\u2019m lying to my family because they don\u2019t want to know me so I feel like I am just a waste of space and a disappointment to not only them but my girlfriend. I want to see her again, but I don\u2019t have the drive or the discipline to get a job. I\u2019m scared she going to break up with me if I don\u2019t get my shit together (she\u2019s never once implied this or given me any reason to think this but I think I just have a lot of anxiety surrounding the issue).\nI know this doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and is really just word vomit but if anyone can give me some kind of first step towards getting better I\u2019d appreciate it.",

Furthermore treatments can be better assessed. Id also say its quite commen for  for a low to appear after relapsing. If your brain rapidly optains alot of dopamin in a short period of time (Triggerwarning: that being threw Selfharm, Drugs ect.), it is actually quite challenging for the brain to handle. Therefore a low afterwards is almost unaviodble. If you wanna ovecome the relapses you will need to find a natural Dopamine source, like drawing, writing a poem, going for a walk ect.

It\u2019s not super talking about in my family but we think he has been dealing with some form of it since about 13. It started with spending a lot time alone playing video games so my parents didn\u2019t think THAT much of it, but it has quickly and quietly dwindled. My parents are on vacation now so I am back at my family house with him getting an up close look as to what has been going on. I have been here for 4 days and the only time that I see him is when I make dinner and call him down. He eats for 10 minutes and goes right back upstairs to his room with the door shut. He does not come out of his room AT ALL besides that. I think my family tries to be over sensitive with him and never ask anything of him at all (he does not help with upkeep of the house at 20 yrs old. Never taken out the garbage or has washed a dish. While me and my younger siblings always help and he\u2019s never had a job) but maybe some responsibility would do him good ? \nHe has been in therapy since elementary school and was just put on anti depressants about 3 months ago, though it seems this is the worst it has ever been. \nOf course, I m going to talk to my parents because I fear as his sister there is not much I can do myself. Whenever I go on a walk, I ask him to come with me he says no. I can\u2019t make him do things, even things that are good for him. \nWhat can I / my family do for him? I worry that the dr will just up his dosage or put him on more pills . But his dr has never even suggested seeing sunlight once a day or moving his legs for 5 minutes.. they just push the meds.

I'd defer to their judgement, or if you don't like the doctor, consult another doctor and compare what they say.  \nHow do you know the dr hasn't suggested what you've mentioned? It's almost always the first thing they suggest, and they are ignored. Usually because the patient is too depressed for self care. The pills often enable people to begin to take steps towards self care. If they've been depressed for seven years, I find it very doubtful sunlight and walking will be enough without medication.  \nHow would getting him to do the dishes or the garbage help his depression? I understand it's what's expected from someone living in a household, but framing it as being good for depression doesn't make sense to me. As for what to do, I think your parents may have it right. Keeping things stable, and him looked after while he acclimatizes to his new meds. If they don't work try different meds, different therapy. Rinse and repeat until something improves.",

 "text": "Not sure what to do, could use advice. So, I'm a \"normal\" 23 y/o guy; no major physical health issues, no major mental health issues (aside from depression of course), a supportive family, a couple decent friends, no s/o, a vehicle, a pet, ect. So I'm not doing too horrible, I've had a good hand dealt to me but thus far everything I've done has only been because I was expected to because of the status quo. Ever since I can recall I haven't really wanted to be alive and I still don't, if I wasn't worried about negatively impacting my family I likely would've called it good already because this whole thing seems kinda pointless. However I've reached another transition point in life and I'm trying to figure out what to do going forward. I'm not so depressed that imma do anything risky but I still don't see the point in keeping up doing what other people want my whole existence. \nI'd like to hear what other people have done to keep pushing through all this pointlessness. I've asked a ton of people for advice but almost everyone gives me seemingly unintelligent suggestions or advice for someone that sees a reason to live to begin with. I feel I've lived enough so far so I'm ready to finally be selfish for once but I'm aware it's a one-way trip so I'm not in a rush at all and I'm entirely in control of my mental faculties.\nI'd just like some input from other people that have dealt with similar states of mind and understand this apathy. All input is greatly appreciated, I am also safe and won't do anything to myself,  of course. Just want information.",

Second of all do you have a job? I believe this is sooo underrated, because honestly I\u2019m much more depressed when I don\u2019t have much to do, and way happier when I work a lot. What is your purpose right now( I know it sounds super cliche but it\u2019s true) what do you know that you are happy doing all the time, not just when your really motivated. You sound like me, and when I was at my worst it was when I had absolutely no idea what was next. Now I think I know and I\u2019m working towards it, keeping my mind busy.",

I've given honest attempts to most the common suggestions like exercise, getting a pet, talking to therapists, confiding in a friend, eating healthy, antidepressants, finding hobbies, traveling, and a few other things but they never seem to provide more than temporary relief from the thoughts of apathy and pointlessness, and after the first couple times it doesnt really work anymore. I don't really feel happy ever, just kinda meh. I can distract myself for short periods but it takes a lot to keep my mind busy and whenever I'm doing that I'm very likely ignoring my responsibilities, at least for the duration of the distraction.",

 "text": "Military ended my personality. I just exist but desperately want to disappear. I want to get out so badly but time seems to pass so slowly.\nAbout me: I\u2019m 20 years old, child of divorce with 2 middle class parents. I did well in high school, I liked history and economics. I was happy, yes I\u2019d had moments where I wasn\u2019t but I had never truly experienced depression. I wasn\u2019t popular but I wasn\u2019t an outcast, I was able to make friends with just about anyone. \nI graduated high school and was working at a UPS warehouse earning decent money for an 18 year old. One day a co worker in his 40s was talking to me, as it turns out he gone to the same school as me. I got hit with a sense of stagnation that if I didn\u2019t do something I would end up like him, working an entry level job for the rest of my life. I\u2019d missed the window for college, blown off my SATs (Covid timeframe) and decided to go talk to a recruiter. They told me all these wonderful lies that I wanted to hear, I\u2019d always had an interest in history so I figured why not live it in a sense while also giving myself purpose and commitment. \nMilitary experience: I went to boot camp, got through it with the expectation that somehow the fleet would be better. I enjoyed the initial freedom ITB gave me but after being forced into an MOS i didn\u2019t want my opinion was soured. I get to the fleet and immediately spiral into the worst depression i have ever experienced. I hated my life, I hated my job, I hated my peers and seniors. I was a shell of my former self, displaying all the characteristics of normal person but internally there was nothing, every time i crossed the street I hoped a car would hit me just so I wouldnt have to exist, I wanted to disappear, I wanted my old life back. A year and a half goes by and I\u2019m no longer a boot, no longer treated like the lowest form of life but the old me isn\u2019t back. I feel nothing, no joy no happiness and no peace. The only tangible emotions I can feel are disappointment (in myself), disgust with the marine corps and anxiety. I simply do not exist as a person, I\u2019m just a sum of parts, my PFT and CFT, Jepes. I am alone and miserable, I want nothing more to do with the military yet I want the benefits enough to not purposely fail a drug test. I neglect my mental health for years and I want so desperately to return to a society that judges people on their character, I don\u2019t want to feel like some soulless husk. I hate where I am, what I\u2019m surrounded by and what it really is behind the curtain. \nIf anyone wants to reach out please do, none of my \u201cfriends\u201d know how I feel and I continue with this facade as those that have shared their true feelings have received ridicule and ostracized.",

Just asking cos you sound so much like me and I suspect I might be bipolar and the acronyms are confusingly similar. \nI suspect I have bipolar2 as I have quite unpredictable periods of not quite full manic but very heightened, energised, driven and elevated periods between the depressive episodes. I\u2019m still figuring out my brain and trying to work out everything going on but currently no treatment due to finances.\nMy psychologist once said we can try to name it all, or we can focus on getting better, but fuck it I want to be able to name and identify all the things that make me feel shit on a daily basis!\nSorry ADHD tandem\u2026 I wanted to ask you if \nyour manager is an old man??

But yes, I think we do struggle with simular things - I really relate to those moments of intense energy followed by intense depression I believe both cam be seen in either disorder? I'm not sure. I also agree with needing to know what's causing all of this. I never got the actual diagnosis of BPD as I didn't want this to follow me around, (and a few other reasons) but I still needed to know that this is what I am suffering from. Does that make sense ?  My manager is the same age as I am, I think he's just clueless or never felt what it's like to be so sick. Not sure, he's a great guy but he really sucks sometimes. I hope things are going alright for you! Sending lots of hope and happiness your way!",

I also feel that the meaning of \u201cofficially diagnosed\u201d varies so much across the world anyway. Like here a psychologist can\u2019t diagnose ADHD but in other countries they can etc. \nI don\u2019t know much about BPD. Except for what\u2019s mentioned in Crazy Ex Girlfriend. Have you seen it? One of my favourites.\nI\u2019ve only been learning about bipolar recently cos I had a really dark depressive episode, and it got me thinking how vastly different it was to the euphoric and energised state I\u2019d been in for almost two weeks leading up to that. \nI\u2019d noticed the mood cycles before and asked my psychiatrist about bipolar last year but he was quite dismissive so I let it go. Also it didn\u2019t feel like a perfect fit because I\u2019ve never experienced true mania with delusions and stuff.\nUp to this week I\u2019d only really heard about bipolar1 and didn\u2019t understand the difference between the two types. I realised I strongly relate to BP2 which has hypomanic, depressive or mixed episodes but no mania. \nSeems to be lots of overlap with all of the different disorders though. So interesting but also so confusing!",

I needed somewhere to put this\u2026 and seeding that I am in the start of figuring out what came first (ADHD or depression), I needed to vent.\nMy parents are moving apart. It\u2019s not a shock, but I don\u2019t know what I feel anymore. My dad messaged me about it and after that I felt numb, it was going so well today as well. Every day I don\u2019t really feel anything. At first I thought it was just directed by being tired or maybe that\u2019s just who I am, but now this void of emotional numbness is drowning me.

 "text": "I just need the courage to end my life I don't know what I have to change, but I just can't connect with anyone. I have no passions or enthusiasm for life. I still try to talk to people and start conversations but I don't really know what to say to people. I'm too paranoid about saying stupid or awkward things because of judgement and social rejection I experienced countless times in the past. These days I struggle to feel any positive emotions towards anyone at all. I'm certain that nobody will ever truly care about me or my life enough to be my friend anyways. When I try to socialize it feels like people just don't care about or relate to what I'm saying. So I find myself desperately reading about social skills even though talking to people is always an unenjoyable experience for me.\nI try to relax but if I just let everything go then my face is just blank and I look stupid. I know this because I'll often turn to look at myself in a reflective surface if I have one next to me just a second after I'm finished with an interaction. It seems like the only way for me to get by in this world is to be a completely fake person. \nNone of my smiles are genuine because I just smile because I think I have to in the given situation. If you don't smile enough people think you are rude, creepy, any number of really bad things. I'm just not able to feel good feelings around other people anymore I guess. I try to convince myself to like other people but I'm not \"normal\" enough to be treated normally by other people. People instinctively don't trust me and I'm constantly trying to raise my inner confidence and coming up short.\nThere's not a day that goes by that I don't at least seriously consider suicide at least once. Between having to work so hard to survive and not being able to connect to others and have friends, I struggle to see the point. I'm not able to have passions. I feel like I'm not allowed to like things and now I don't really have an emotional reaction to anything.\nThe only positive emotion I feel is relief, but never real happiness. I'm not able to make myself laugh. I can only kinda sorta laugh at other things, but I can only enjoy humor for so long before I start to realize again that I will never be able to produce funny things and be a fun person like others can. I try to learn but it's hard to really understand other people. My tone is always messed up when I try to be friendly or joke around anyways. If I make someone laugh it's only to gain their apporoval. It feels like work and nothing I say makes me laugh. I just kind of say things that I think in my head have a probability of making someone else laugh and then I try it. Sometimes it works, a lot of times it doesn't. I can't make myself laugh. \nI don't know what to do about being so dead inside. I'm not capable of enjoying another person's company because I am always worried about being labelled as a weird, stupid person. I'm only able to put on a performance for others and hope that they respect me at the very least. Not many people do respect or like me anyways.\nThey say you have to be vulnerable to be likable but I don't know how to do that. I'm not even able to feel happy about talking to another person with no worry of judgement no matter who it is. It could be my mom, it could be an old \"friend\", it could be the coworkers I see almost every day. I just feel like I'm in the lion's den when I socialize and if I relax I just come off as dead inside because I have no interest in people, places or things. They say you have to change yourself to make yourself interested in stuff but I don't know how. \nSometimes I think I'm too stupid for any of this. I don't pick up on patterns anymore. I'm not able to think about what to say to another person without them thinking it's weird in some way. Everything I do to try to relate to others feels forced. It seems like my memory in general doesn't work well enough anymore to be able to socialize. The plethora or relatable social and general life conventions people draw on to socialize are always lost on me. \nI am always primarily concerned with survival and being able to afford food and a roof over my head and I can't imagine that getting any better. I'm not able to find joy in this life of survival. The struggle is always on my mind and I'm not able to be lighthearted and happy around others. It seems like absolutely no one I've ever met can relate to that. People just downplay things if you're sad.\nFor example someone in my sobriety group therapy was crying one session due to his struggles in life. When he's not there, the counselor just pithily refers to him having a \"rough time\" like you would talk about a little kid who just scraped their knee. \nBut it's more serious than that. It's not possible to just choose to be happy. Everywhere I turn there's more proof that this life isn't worth anything. I'm probably fucked with brain damage or something. Whatever is wrong doesn't matter I guess. \nI don't even want to be happy. They say people like me choose sadness and I think that is true, but it isn't my fault. I'm not able to keep being happy when I'm socially awkward in a social interaction. I'm not able to keep being happy when I have to be with/around other people. Everything about socializing makes me feel depressed and I have to do it every single day for the rest of my life. There's no point in the torture. I will always ruin the vibe and people are better off without me. I am just a burden and my life will always be an uphill struggle to not be a burden on other people.\nI'm going to go workout and go for a run, then take a cold shower. Even though I don't want to do any of it. Life is only about doing things because you have to. There's nothing to be happy about fighting to survive every day. I just want to take some kind of medicine that will make my heart stop in my sleep.",

What's wrong with not saying when you just wanted them to listen to you? I understand wanting to be accepted by others, but who cares what they think? You put yourself down there, not them. Sure it's easy to be sad always about something, everyone always has something to be sad about. The thing is you're throwing anything good or be happy about out the door like it doesn't matter. If you only had one thing to be happy about, then what's wrong about being happy for that one thing? If someone who cared about you and you said you have nothing good or to be happy about, how does that make them feel? That you see them as nobody to you is how you make them feel. There are millions of people doing far worse than you and you can't be thankful for not being one of those people? I'm sure they have a lot less and still capable of being happy and thankful for what they DO have. Depression sucks I know. Sometimes I don't even have the energy to get out of bed, but when I'm not bed, I'm going to use the energy I do have and make better use of it instead of overthinking things that never really didn't belong there in the first place. Maybe it's not about being happy or sad. What you need is confidence. One day when you truly have that for yourself, you will notice a whole new world open up to you, but the world never changed to begin with. It's how you were looking at it that changed. You will notice all the things invisible to you that you refused to even acknowledge they were there. You will see it was all in your head. You must tell yourself not to be sad or dwell what you can't change. You must believe in yourself no matter what it takes. Do this and watch everything change for the better.",

Nothing motivates me in any way particularly. I have no desire for power, money, dominance, to be remembered, anything of the sort. To me, a lot of those things are arbitrary in nature. I just want to be able to do what I want to do, live with minimal regret, have a positive impact on the people I care about, to not repeat my own mistakes or the mistakes of others, to have love and empathy for myself and to be true to myself always. I feel I have succeeded in living by these standards in a way, but something is still missing and I\u2019m assuming will always feel missing. I feel like it\u2019s just something I need to learn to live with, like a lot of things. \u00a0\nI haven\u2019t had a close, intimate relationship in a very long time, nearly 7 fucking years. I spent such a long time grieving about the end of my last relationship and generally lamenting the mistakes I\u2019d made, that I\u2019ve managed to alienate myself into thinking that I\u2019ll never change and that I\u2019ll most probably never be that close to anyone ever again. Whenever someone makes an attempt to get close to me, or if I have any opportunity to really get to know someone, I either close myself off or push them away. My ego can\u2019t deal with rejection, which is fucking hilarious as I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of rejection in my life but can never ever really get used to it at all. I feel like I give off the impression and general image of being happy in my own company and living by my own rules (I probably think I do but in actuality I\u2019m probably transparent as fuck), but the truth is that like everyone else, I really want to be loved and understood. Not only do I want that, I want to be able to love somebody else. \u00a0\nI feel like I can never get out of the this cocoon I\u2019ve made for myself, constructed through all the bitterness, scorn and insecurity I\u2019ve been harboring for years, and that I\u2019ll be alone until I die. I want to open my heart and let someone in, as incredibly lame as that sounds, but something is always standing in the way of this. It\u2019s a really tough thing to balance, self sufficiency and not being codependent on the approval and admiration of others with the general need to be cared about and wanted. I feel that this balancing act will persist for the rest of my life and I\u2019ll never be content with what I have, adding to the familiar sense of doom that I mentioned previously. I know I\u2019ve ranted on sporadically about a myriad of things, but if anyone feels the same way or has felt the same way, please say. If you have any advice, for any points I\u2019ve mentioned, it is hugely welcome. For anyone who\u2019s going to be a prick in the comments, fuck you in advance.\u00a0\nCheers and apologies for the awful writing. It just feels nice to vent.",

(Engaged for 2, together for 10.)  It blew back in my face as usual and he got defensive and shut down; screamed at me for an extensive period of time and then stormed out. He took control like he always does and oppressed me and my need to express my feelings. \nWe have not slept in the same room in a month. Tonight I thought there was no way out other than to take every single pill and medication that\u2019s prescribed to me and drift away for good. But this would only inconvenience my partner and if he had to take me to the hospital or if he found me unconscious, he would be even more pissed at me that I inconvenienced and interrupted his work day. \nI called my best friend and she talked me down from this cliff. But shouldn\u2019t you be able to turn to your partner when you\u2019re feeling down without being afraid? \nThere\u2019s no way out of here. I\u2019m stuck and even though I am working so hard on myself, it will never be good enough. In his eyes and my own. \nHere\u2019s hoping I can pull through this and continue fighting and establishing independence. \nHere\u2019s to easily reaching over to your nightstand but NOT ODing because of the way another person treats you.",

Tried to date my father wanted me to find a good woman that would be my rock and steady me, but I hate myself so how could I find someone when I can\u2019t stand myself. I can't sleep at night because I have either unbelievably bad nightmares that will wake me or because of a herniated disk in my back pain that keeps me from falling asleep. I could never sleep even as a child I fought sleep. My father was murdered on a night like tonight (how I wish it could have been me) and after 21 years it still fucks with me especially on nights like tonight.\nI want to get better, but medication doesn\u2019t work. It makes me more suicidal; I have tried ECT did not work, tried TMS did not work. I don\u2019t trust therapists, so I never tell them what\u2019s truly going on.\nI get into screaming arguments with family. Take tonight accused my niece of stealing and once she left the house, I caught it from my mother and my sister stating I am accusing her without proof. I don\u2019t have proof, but I know what I know. So, after a 2-hour screaming match, I locked myself in my room. It\u2019s now extremely late and she still has not come home. her I\u2019ve tried to apologize but the damage has been done. Now watch she doesn\u2019t make it home something happens to her, and it will be all my fault because it is and everything, I do is wrong and my fault just not tonight but all the time.\nWhy am I such a coward that I am still here, why doesn\u2019t nothing work I just keep getting further and further from being any type of person that should still be breathing. I hope I die of a heart attack soon. I know I can\u2019t continue doing this and no sleep let\u2019s hope for death soon. There\u2019s no longer anything left. I made sure that I have successfully burned all bridges I can't enjoy even the simplest things anymore. I just in this haze that time is moving slow keeping me alive for as long as it can.  Once I get death everybody that is around me will be better. I welcome death but that eludes me time after time.",

Was manic yesterday, saddest bastard around today. \nI can't get this recurring thought out of my head, I'm playing russian roulette, toying with fate, pull the trigger, and it's empty. Pull it again and again and again, hitting every empty chamber leaving me with the only one with a bullet in it. I toss the revolver aside and just lie down on the floor, crying myself to sleep. \nI don't self harm, well, not anymore. I have no intent on attempting or completing, every method is just too much effort. I respond to stress by lashing out and pushing people away, accidental or intentional. But after I calm down I almost always beg and plead for forgiveness. I can't be the hero and I'm too soft to even be the villain. It's just pathetic. \nI'm just tired of living, this shit sucks. I've got loved ones yeah, but what good are they when I can rarely even talk to them? I just hate everyone else around me. Hate might be exaggerating but nobody else makes me happy. They either contribute nothing or just straight up make me feel worse. I'm stuck either super hyper and excited over nothing but easily irritable or I can't fucking get out of bed. Near constant thoughts of suicide but none of the gall required to just do it. I want to die yet fear death. A walking contradiction until something or someone does my job for me.\n\u200b\nTl;dr: Whiny teen hates themselves and is OD'ing on copium",

I had to move out with my dad, who constantly neglected us me and my disabled sister.\nthe time I lived with my father I went through hunger, loneliness and extreme depression.\nTwo years ago I couldn't get up from my bed, i used to sleep about 11 or 12 hours a day, waking up at 6pm and sometimes not eating for days, i failed highschool and everything I tried to achieve. Yet some family members who were worried about me got me in therapy and into pills.\nLast year I started having a serious problem with drugs, like xans and similars, i developed an adiction, and sadly, it was the best thing that happened me in a long time.\nFor first time in years I got all the fun i wanted, i meet new friends, I started dating a girl, i got good grades and generally i just was having a good time.\nBut when my need for pills got heavier I started fucking everything up, making all the people i knew mad, and having a lot of troubles with almost everyone i knew.\nThis girl broke with me and spread a false accusations about me being a creep, i cut bounds with my new friends and most important, I had to leave my house because my dad beat me up and I couldn't stand more abuses.\nI was sleeping on a different house everyday,\nMy bigger brothers first gave me a hand, but then, they got tired about me being depressed and having to live in their house, i wasn't even 18 at that moment and only thing I had was my backpack and the things it.\nSome time after that my brothers finally kicked me violently out of their houses.\nNow I live with an old friend of my mom, I had to get an awfull job in the summer and I just started my last year before college.\nThings may seem better but believe me they aren't, i don't get well with the person I live with, yet i always try to do the best for her bc of the help she is giving me letting me live in her house.\nI got only one friend, who currently is going through a similar situation, all my family has forgot about me, i was just a burden for them and they look happy about not having to care about me anymore.\nThe story is longer and I skipped some things because the post is long enough already.\nI genuinely have nothing, no family, almost no friends, and no will to live anymore\nIm just alive for not reason at all, I'm not afraid of death, I'm such a pussy for being incapable of taking my own life.\nIm just desperate, i really don't know what to do, i tried as hard as I could but it has passed a long time and nothing has changed.",

But I know it's a lot of work having to deal with a depressed friend, so I can understand why no body is my friend. \nBut I also have this undiagnosed autism that I probably have that makes it hard to know if someone is my friend or just being friendly. \nI don't know how often someone should send text messages. All I know is that people never initiated conversation with ME. I always had to be the first to say something, at least with the people who I had in my life until recently.\nSo out of spite I deleted my Facebook this January and now the 8 \"friends\" I had on there are now gone, including my cousin who I no longer talk to. But I had deleted other people out of spite for the same reason on there years ago. Of course, I'm kind of a hypocrite because I never initiated conversation either. But I even lost touch with my extroverted friends who usually used to initiate conversation. It's as if I'd been forgotten by everyone.\nBut I don't have a Facebook anymore so I can officially say that I have no friends. But it really hurts knowing that no one is going to be at my funeral.  So I just refresh reddit to see if I have any new messages, the pitiful human connection-deprived person I am, before going back to my usual state of anhedonia and suicidality.",

I am asking for advice.\nSince I have moved back in with my parents, every once in a while, they will \"accidentally\" open my mail. I am someone who takes their privacy seriously. But I didn't get upset the first few times because it very well could have been an honest mistake. \nFast forward about a year, they still \"accidentally\" open my mail. At least once a month. Today it happened again. I asked them to stop opening my mail. I told them that I have to remind them once a month. I expressed my frustration about this. It quickly turned into my mom screaming at me saying it's her house. Her property. Her mailbox. Bla bla bla. I told her that it is still illegal to open my mail regardless of where it ends up. She didn't believe me. So I sent a screenshot of the law saying that it is illegal. I am an adult. I have rights. Its really not that difficult.\nBoth my parents stormed in and screamed at me. We went back and forth. Threatening to kick me out. Me saying \"just don't open my mail. Idk why that is so difficult\". \nMy dad punched my door and took a couple steps forward at me. I calmed down and said \"ok. How about we just leave eachother alone tonight. And we can talk tomorrow morning when everyone has calmed down.\" My dad punching the door and screaming at me was very surprising because my dad is a great person. He is smart and logical. So this was a shock when I saw him punching the door and screaming at me.\nRight after I said that, they started blaming my medication. They seriously believe that I am acting this way because of my medication. Funny thing is, I've been arguing with them about respecting my privacy before I even started taking ADHD meds. So I don't understand their logic here.\nThey forced me to give them all of my medication. Which I'm pretty sure is also illegal since I am an adult. \nI am pretty sure that stealing mail and/or taking someone's medication, a controlled substance, is highly illegal. But I don't want to report them for this all because they let their anger get the best of them. I also love them dearly. I don't want them to suffer the law because of this. But idk what to do.\nThey don't realize that if I lose my medication, I will be worse than I supposedly was. I was so depressed before I started taking my prescription. These meds have quite literally saved my life..\nI am debating moving out. But the whole reason I moved back in with them is because I couldn't afford to live on my own. I don't know what to do. I am looking for some advice here. Can I explain this to my doctor to get a new prescription without getting them in trouble? What do you guys think I should do? Am I being too unreasonable? \nThanks in advance",

So over the past year my friends have noticed I haven\u2019t been really down and depressed lately to the point where I\u2019d be ignoring/not replying to messages not hoping online with them, giving cold responses on calls. \nTo make me feel better, they planned a trip with me to go get out of the country and have some fun. And whilst I\u2019m very introverted/not really good at socialising I was all for it.\nBut knowing my luck, I finally got a job offer (temp, 3 month contract with chance of renewal) it pays well and the experience would be great on my cv even if I don\u2019t get my contract extended. And since I\u2019ve been stuck in retail for the past year I finally felt like I\u2019d secured a W and could progress in my life even if it was only a temporary thing. (Being stuck in retail was ruining my mental too)\nHowever this contract clashes with the time I was supposed to go on holiday. So I told my friends about the situation but because they already planned everything and they need to be back at a certain time they wouldn\u2019t budge on moving the holiday. \nAt first I thought okay I\u2019ll just reject the offer but I started having second thoughts. This job is only temporary but I feel like it would be a good step in the direction for myself since I\u2019ve been so lost with my career choices. \nBut I also think the holiday would do me some good to forget about all the other stuff and really enjoy myself and maybe boost my confidence in social situations. (I haven\u2019t been on holiday in over 5/6 years) I think my issue is I\u2019m trying to please both parties. \nThese are my closest friends and I don\u2019t wanna make them thinking I\u2019m ducking the holiday (I\u2019ve said no to a lot of events like this in the past due to me being so introverted) \nBut the more I think about it the more stupid I think I\u2019ve been choosing a holiday over a job. Part of me feels my friends won\u2019t have the time to do something like this again (we\u2019re all 23/24 and they want to go for a month) which is why I wanna go and make them happy. \nBut since I haven\u2019t found anything decent in terms of jobs I feel like I\u2019ve thrown everything back in the faces of the people who gave me the offer. \nMy friends thought I should make an excuse to leave the job early but I wanted to be honest with them so I told them my situation. They said they\u2019d get back to me yesterday but so far I haven\u2019t heard anything from them which I think is a bad sign. I asked to see if it was possible to do part of my contract, go on holiday then come back and finish it (which I honestly think was a silly move and a slap in the face to the employer). \nSince I haven\u2019t heard back I think I\u2019ve blown my chances and I guess this is the price you pay for trying to please multiple people at once. \nJust feels like every time something goes right something has to go wrong in return.",

I am currently looking to recruit participants to complete my online research study that is part of my dissertation in clinical psychology. My research focuses on understanding the concept of Fear of Depression Recurrence, which captures fears that people who are remitted from depression may have about becoming depressed again. The goal of this online study is to gain a better understanding of the construct and validate the psychometric properties of a Fear of Depression Recurrence questionnaire. We hope that learning more about fear of depression recurrence may present a small window into understanding depression relapse and thus lead to better informed prevention efforts. \nThe mods of this subreddit have vetted my study (which has received ethical approval from my institution) and verified my identity.\nInterested? Here is some more information about the study:\nWere you ever diagnosed with depression? Do you feel better now?\nThe Stress and Developmental Psychopathology Laboratory at Concordia University is currently recruiting English-speaking participants for a study investigating the potential fears that people who are no longer depressed may have about their depression returning. This study involves completing online questionnaires that assess the fears you may have about your depression returning, as well as the severity, frequency, content, and triggers of these fears. It will also ask you for basic personal information (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, occupation) and questions about your current depressive symptoms, other mental health concerns, beliefs about depression, coping strategies, and quality of life. \nThe online survey will take approximately 1 hour to complete. All components of this study can be completed remotely, in the comfort of your own home. \nParticipants who are eligible and complete our online survey will be entered in a draw to win one of seven $100 CAD Amazon Gift cards. \nIf you are interested and you:\n\u2714\u00a0\u00a0 Are above the age of 18 \n\u2714\u00a0\u00a0 Have previously experienced an episode of depression\n\u2714\u00a0\u00a0 Have no significant symptoms of depression during the last 2 months\nPlease click on the following link which will bring you to our pre-screening questionnaire to determine your eligibility. If eligible, you will be able to access our consent form and the online survey from this same link.\nSurvey Link: https://concordiaccrh.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8v5TiIGO7rSk5kG",

My neck was stiff I was extremely irritable my vison blurry and static and colors look greyed and lifeless my perception of depth and reality are completely off. Peoples faces for some reason look aggresive to me like there judging me. Going out in public is really difficult for me I get paranoid thoughts. It's extremely difficult to read it's like i just see letters but can't make sense of it and comprehend what I'm reading. I slurr and have difficulty recalling my words. My emotions and sense of empathy have been completely numbed the only thing i feel strongly is anger. My voice is extremely monotone. \nI feel like I had a stroke but I got an mri scan of my brain and everything came back completely normal. All the mri showed is a sinus infection and nasal polyp.\nThis all happened to me in the span of one night. Each morning I wake up and my vision and control over my emotions is better than the day before. Each day I wake up people look less and less threatening and I feel as if I'm maturing physically and mentally. Each day I'm more human and less robot. If anyone is going through anything like this please let me know what condition this is I hate having to wait so long just to be myself again.",

 "text": "Wanting to take time off work to focus on mental health I work a remote job in the tech industry. It can be demanding, but lately it's been ok. Prior to taking this job a year ago, I was unemployed from getting laid off in 2020. I took most of 2020, 2021 and the first part of 2022 attempting to focus on health issues and dealing with depression. I realize now I really didn't focus on my health from 2020-2022 because I was just a nervous wreck about things in the past and was trying to move too fast in my mental health journey. I think I might need to just take another break. Most likely, I might need to quit my job.\nI've tried therapy, medications and just working it out on my own. Each has some use, but ultimately each one has its limitations. I just feel tired all the time and panicked.\nPros of leaving my job are that I can focus on my health 100%. This time around, I know not to rush things and how to completely focus instead of having one foot in the future and one in the past. Getting rest would be great.\nCons are I'd blow through my savings, and with a recession looming, might not be able to find another job when I need money. Also, I'd have to start paying for my own health insurance again and potential therapy bills. I guess also, there's a self-esteem issue in being unemployed again, which could send me in a downward spiral. \nI've been working here for almost year, and I'd like to have at least a year here so I can get back into the labor force if I need to. However, dragging out these issues doesn't seem wise since I'm really not the most productive worker as a result.\nI am in the US, and any thoughts about this are welcome. Thank you.",

 "text": "Rotting in university while being so ill I'm currently in one of my worst depressive episodes that i've ever experienced. I messed up the math test the other day, i mistook the date for my PE test so that means i failed and i got accounting principles exam in a few hours. I didn't learn anything because i couldn't. My head is going crazy because i can't think of anything else other than how bad things would turn out, how miserable i am , how sore my body is, how badly i want to hurt myself . Depression is one of the worst type of  illnesses ever. It makes me suffer from extreme fatigue EVERY.SINGLE.DAY. I have brain fog so i can't think at all, keep losing my memories, have migraine from time to time, nausea, almost always have tachycardia and anxiety so it's hard to even breathe properly. The stress makes my gastritis so much worse, mess up with my whole digestive system. I even have to hide myself to cry in the bathroom bc im living with my not so close cousin and i dont want her to see that. I barely have any energy to breathe let alone having to go to class at 6a.m every morning. I asked my parents if i could drop out of university and pursue other thing that's actually interesting to me but they didn't allow me and just told me to put up with it , just one year left then I could do anything I want .But NO? Im only mid way thru my 2nd year so it's another two whole years and that's 2 years if i don't fail any class. How ironic when they always say health is the priority when they are doing the exact opposite. I'm literally a moving corspe rn. I can\u2019t even deal with anything that is happening to me at the moment how the hell am I gonna endure 2 more years? Am I not trying hard enough ? Is me being alive or dead not important?( And one of the worst part is we all know the degree is gonna be an useless piece of paper bc I don\u2019t have any intention to work a job that relates to that horrible major ). I\u2019m at my wits end, i don\u2019t know what to do anymore. And gosh my back hurts so much.",

I had a quarter like this during my parents\u2019 divorce, and once I talked to my program\u2019s chair they were actually really understanding and accommodating. I did take a hardship withdrawal from one course but got some deadlines extended in others and was able to retake a missed exam. Wasn\u2019t my best quarter for grades but I survived. Of course ymmv and not saying this will be the solution to everything, but it might ease up the academic pressure you\u2019ve been under, and ime when things are hard anything that you can feel a little bit positively about can make a big difference.

In fact, you feel more alone than you did before you left \u2026 But you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone.\u201d \n- Bojack Horseman",

 "text": "Feeling terrible post-surgery, unemployed, hopeless Had hernia surgery a few days ago and the recovery has really taken a toll on my mood. So now instead of being a depressed person, I'm now a depressed person with pain.\nI can't feel motivated to do anything. I just want to sleep all day, but what would that accomplish? I could try to look for work, but I've already looked through 10+ pages on Indeed today and found nothing.\nMy anhedonia has also gotten really bad. I can't seem to enjoy anything, whether it be Youtube videos or video games. I have no sex drive, which is probably a good thing because having a libido makes me feel more forever alone.\nIt's 6 P.M. now, and not too long it will be 10 P.M., and I've accomplished nothing. I've neither had the opportunity to work on things or relax. I've only been able to make reddit posts, feel suicidal, talk to a crisis counselor who was unhelpful, and then talk to my mom who started talking about how I shouldn't kill myself because I'll go to hell.\nI can't think of a worse day I've had in recent months. I'm not even sure how to sign out of this post.",

I got cheated on by every women iv ever met and have been told it's hard to love an ugly guy. And finally got a girl I think cares and fuck it up by cheating on her and when I admitted it to her she forgave me and hugged me and that guilt weighs heavy cause I want to be left alone I make mistake after mistake and don't know what to do please help me please I feel allne and just want to scream. I'm in the hospital rn and think when I get home maybe that will be that I'm so tired of being a fuckup and tired of losing everything.

 "text": "I\u2019m so tired of living like this.. A year ago I was diagnosed with hpv. My life completely shut down. I only i had one sexual partner ever. I was in an abusive relationship but thankfully I could get out of this. Imagine urself trying to have sex for the first time because i hated when people judged me for not losing my virginity and now i ended up with std. I thought I could live my life again but no I have to deal with this fucking disease. I got treatments  and I had a few months living a normal life without worrying. Back then i believed the virus wouldn\u2019t stay in my body forever so I moved on. I started talking to someone else who is my current boyfriend right now. I didn\u2019t think about this shit cause I thought my body could clear it. When we got into a relationship all of the sudden Ive been keeping thinking about this and I finally told him what I went through last year. I assume myself always contagious bc theres no way to tell the virus is gone. I wanted to tell him so he could decide if he wanted to stay with me or not as i didn\u2019t want to waste our time.. he still wanna be with me and decide to get the vaccine soon. Everybody knows its not 100% effective and my bf doesn\u2019t know much about this so probably this is why he still wanna stay with me.. my health anxiety is getting worse lately. I can\u2019t work or study or enjoy my life. I used to be a good student who always got a good grade in class. now i\u2019m almost failing the class butI\u2019m trying my best every single day. I\u2019m worrying i will get cancer one day. I live in fear, wake up with anxiety. I can\u2019t tell anyone about this. I can't keep telling my boyfriend what I'm struggling with since he can't always understand how hard it is, and of course, you don't want to be with someone who keeps being negative and has an STD while there are a lot of fish in the ocean .i feel i\u2019m worthless, he still likes me a lot but i feel i don\u2019t deserve him. I had a thought that i didn\u2019t want to live anymore. Whenever I looked at my mom, I felt myself so awful. She gave me a good life but I ruined it just because I had sex with someone who abused and harassed me? I hate how stupid I was. I\u2019m depressed, tired, struggling with my life right now. I want to live a normal life, have worry free, finish college degree and have a job like normal people. I still have lots of places that i wanna travel to. This shit hurt and ruin my life completely. I\u2019m going to see a therapist next week :)",

 "text": "Can't Get Help, but Wants and Needs It I (22F) have been struggling on and off since I was around 11. I've been under consistent psychiatric and counseling care since mid 2020 as a result of being in and out of treatment programs for my eating disorder (that by the way, I'm not actively using behaviors but my thoughts are consistent with ED). \nThe feeling I have now, it's like nothing I've felt before. It's been here for a while, at this intensity. I have this strong disillusionment for everything around me. I've lost all hope really, there's nothing in this world that sticks out to me as worth anything to be enticing. I only leave the house on weekends for my job. I'm taking time off from college after not being able to get out of bed after transferring (stupidly, I was less than a full semester's worth of classes away from my original degree). I transferred so I could be happy after having issues at my previous college and it being laced with memories of my active eating disorder. I switched my original major after a professor told me that she didn't think I was that passionate about music as I originally thought I was. It ruined everything for me, and at a small college, I had no other option in voice teacher. \nI was going to a new music program after that being my true passion. I didn't make any friends last semester. I have no friends now besides my husband. We got married last summer. In a way, he was the only way out from the claws of my narcissistic mother. I still don't know how to drive and didn't have a job until college. I went NC with her last year. \nI stay at home day and I do nothing. I know I have promise but it's pointless. Everything is. I feel so worthless and I just know that everything I've ever promised to myself was pointless. \nI don't feel like I can connect to any other human in my life. I don't feel like I even connect to anyone else. I seriously think that something is wrong with me and that also causes me a large amount of distress. I know that I'm different. I know that I always have been and I know my brain isn't like everyone else's. \nI now pretty consistently get high or drunk whenever I want to self harm, or whenever I don't want to feel anything. I don't do it every day, couple times a week, but I know it may be maladaptive. It's of concern. My therapist thinks I may have PMDD too which doesn't help anything. I'm too scared to see a GYN because of past trauma, and I can't really take any SSRI. \nI've been thinking a lot of psych wards. I know they aren't great, but I feel like I need a break away from everything, including my husband. But I have deadly food allergies and I've heard and read stories of so many people not getting the right food, only food that would hurt them and then I'd have to not eat to protect myself, but when I stop eating, I'll stop eating myself into a relapse. I even was exposed to my allergens at a residential ED facility after my dietician told me I had nothing to worry about, to alleviate some fears around eating. \nSo, a psych ward could do more harm than good. These are very much passive thoughts, but I'm afraid of escalation. \nI don't know what I want. I'm high right now, so this didn't make any sense I'm sure. I know I'm smarter than the grammar I utilized above, so please believe me on that, my intelligence is the only thing I have some faith in (but even then, I think that maybe I'm not as truly smart as I think I am and am only lying to myself and in real actuality, I'm actually not. It would be the end of me.) Advice would be nice. I know I need to get out of the house, but my husband is at work all day, I can't drive, no public transportation, can't afford rideshare, an intense fear of strangers. I'm also scared to leave my house sometimes now. \nWhatever you say, please don't be a dick. I'm sorry it's long and there's no TLDR, but at least I used paragraphs to break it up.",

Allthough a psyward might seem like a good option just like you stated, it would probably be more harmfull to your mental health then benefitial (Was there 8 Times, it didnt help me at all). Rehab on the other hand might be a more resonable option, since there are diffrent ficilities focusing on diffrent Aspects of mental and physical ilness. Generally they are more build arround the whole concept of health, not just singular aspects. The name Rehab comes from Rehabiliation and as the word suggests the focus is to reintegrate you back in to society (If you have problems with leaving the house just the main concept alone is build to fix that). Not only are Rehabs structured way more firmly (Prioitys in Food, including being Vegetrian/Vegan is not a Problem at Rehabs from where im at) but they can also provide you with medical servies like diagnosis (Mental/Physical) and/or finding a solution to working with prefered decisions (Not wanting meds => I Hate Anti-Depressants btw.). Rehabs also tend to have days where you can visit the facility and look arround, so if you feel unsure about going there, you can take a look before hand. I realy wanna emphesis on the Diagnosis Part here. Getting a Diagnosis never is a fun thing, but on the bright side it opens up gates to further treatment and it is objectivly better to know what youre fighting (From Medical stand point).",

It feels like my depressive mind has made a barrier. I know the answer may be simple but I just can't jump right back in. I'm worn out of rehashing everything and I can't do it again right now. The reasons I went through 3 therapists are: i went into a facility recommended by legit the best therapist I've ever had and by the time I discharged she moved up and wasn't a therapist anymore; in the facility I found another great therapist but he's under the facility and doesn't have his own patients outside of it; and my last one (who I was just starting to get somewhat comfortable with) also moved up same as the first of the 3 and I'm forced to get someone new. \nI've been struggling with my mental health pretty bad since 2017 and only in January of 2022 did I meet the best therapist I've ever had. I'm sure many of you know how difficult it can be to click with a therapist, and once you do, you better hold on because they are so rare. I feel like I broke after being forced to switch again and I just can't go through all of my past. \nI'm well aware that it is completely out of my control, and thus there's nothing I can do except move forward, but I struggle to. I don't know what can get me, personally, on that path again. To be honest, maybe this post is more of a venting, but any words might help a little.",

She then went to my ex\u2019s salon and told them about how I took 2 hours to do them. I\u2019m practicing acrylics and felt really bad after she left. But my ex\u2019s sister laughing at me(which my ex\u2019s best friend who I am still friends with told me about the situation), was the final straw. Why am I still alive? For what reason am I put on this Earth for besides being a failure?",

I have no intention of killing myself.  I just don't enjoy being alive and I don't want to be anymore.  Hobbies don't interest me.  All I do is go to work, smoke pot, and play video games.

It's a colossal waste of time and money I don't have to spare.\nI just don't know what I'm supposed to do.  Dying takes a really fucking long time.  I don't have friends anymore, and I don't want any.  A relationship is right out of the question.  I dont like to interact with the opposite sex.  I'm just confused and sad.

I can\u2019t help it. I feel so lonely and invisible like an actual ghost. I don\u2019t feel important enough for ppl to want to be friends with me and care about me. I try my best to be positive and keep going but lately I\u2019ve been wanting to end myself because I can\u2019t take it anymore. I just want to be loved and have a stable and caring friend group and also a great relationship with my family, peers, and a lover. Is it so hard to ask for?",

Like why wasn\u2019t I able to be like everyone else with a bunch of friends, things to do with them, call and text often, go out places together and such? Was it meant to be alone? If that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t see a point in living anymore. That\u2019s been my feelings since today but I\u2019ve had this thought since I graduated high school.

You're worthy of friendship and happiness just like everyone else, no one deserves to feel lonely. Sadly though there are a ton of people who feel the same, but we all just haven't met our group that we'd click with yet, but they're out there, there's always others that we'd get along with/have similarities with.

We all want attention. We all want people to understand how we feel within our head.\nBut the truth is, no one really cares, like we care. Only we have lived and experienced our life, we each live in our own reality. Must take into consideration that every single person is living their own lives, with their own problems and burdens.     \nI have had clinical depression for about 12 years, and i still do. Within my reality, i have reached the conclusion that there is no such thing as real happiness, only how well we can tolerate the suck. In realizing this, you alleviate yourself from the endless pursuit of \u201chappiness,\u201d and you can instead focus on how you can make your current situation suck less. ie: if you have a job that feels bad, you can get a new job; pursue a hobby that you are interested in; maybe add a little priority to water and sleep; etc.     \nIn my experience, it doesn\u2019t get better\u2026 But you can make it less bad \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

It's left me disabled, housebound and barely making it through each day...for 8 years now. \nAll of my friends both decades long friendships, more casual ones - everyone disappeared over the course of the first 2-3 years. \nI am beyond grateful to have my husband who in all honesty has saved my life more times than I can recall and is my reason for trying to make it through each day. \nBottom line - even when we have people who care - depression doesn't discriminate - it will still hit and destroy everything you hold dear. \nI wish you light and healing and peace and to find someone who cares and is there to pull you up when you fall down.",

 "text": "Just discovered this sub I have been depressed for well over a year. My gf of 5 years broke up with me because she said she wasn't attached to me anymore. Was she ever attached to me? i dunno. The first time we had sex she said she felt guilty because she was just using me. She was so beautiful I didn't much care at the time. But I always thought about but never said anything in case I upset her. Well when we broke up 4 years after that I knew it was because I wasn't as rich as her and her father would never approve of our relationship. (She was a doctor and I was a teacher) For a long long time the two things I thought about was how could I end my life in a way to tie up all loose ends and the little things in our relationship that I didn't think much of but made a lot of sense the type of person she was when I truly analysed it.... like we couldn't hold hands in public lest people think we're together.. shit like that\nWell its been over a year, and the pain is still there but I think i'm focusing on other things and keeping myself busy and doing things I enjoy.. like hookers and weed.\n\u200b\nbut reading the posts on this sub really puts everything into perspective. I'm not alone and neither are any of you. Many people go through trauma like I did, if not ten times worse. But i'm slowing coming to terms with my loneliness and heartbreak by helping other people far worse off than me. \n\u200b\nI wish I could give everyone a hug in this sub and say that it doesn't always get better but you do become used to the pain that it doesn't affect you as much as it used to. \nI won't say time heals all cuz it doesn't... you just become used to the pain and become stronger. \nStay strong, Kings.

Due to being on a different wavelength than most of the world I find it incredibly difficult to even find a worthwhile conversation, let alone love. As such, my circle has always been a tiny one, but now it has shrunken down to nothingness.\nJuly 4th, 2020 is a date I'll always remember. It is the day the last bit of my love died, my cat died from stomach cancer in my arms as I slept. For 20 years she was my best friend because I can't make connections with humans. She was also all I had left, all my meaningful family had died, a girl I thought I had a future with died, hell even the ex-girlfriends I still was friendly with that I loved at one point and fell out of love with...dead. My cat was the only bit of love and happiness I had in the world, and now it has been years since she has been gone as well.\nMy life is thoroughly empty and devoid of incoming and outgoing love. All I have is the vain hope of one day meeting someone who I can love, but I'm becoming increasingly miserable and difficult to love as I continue a miserable empty existence. \nI'm very independent and capable of providing most things for myself, but loving someone else is external and not something I can simply do myself. \nI wish I didn't have the craving for love. I could be completely content with my quiet life of playing video games if I had just one person I could truly, deeply care about. \nEvery day it feels like I'm doomed to be lonely and miserable until I die, and most days I think I should've died years ago when this downward spiral started, would've saved me a lot of grief. \nNot really looking for help or empty words, just felt like ranting and making the rant public.",

 "text": "Idk what to do, my gf is struggling badly First of all, apologies if this isn\u2019t allowed , I have no clue where is best to post this and it\u2019s not exactly an uplifting read - more just asking for advice.\nI\u2019ve been with my gf for 8 years and we\u2019re in our late 20s. I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re not asking the right people but she\u2019s never been able to get any sort of diagnosis or meaningful help with her mental health. From a healthy amount of google and self-diagnosis, she seems to have OCD (she\u2019s had this since her teens) and in more recent years, depression. She was on medication about 2 years ago which she stuck with for maybe 1 year but then stopped as it didn\u2019t seem to be helping. Despite this, she is able to function well at a job within the emergency services where she frequently comes across death and other traumatising scenarios. She does this partially for a love of helping people and is adamant that she does not want to look at less difficult / depressing jobs (just to address one possible response). She does however bring huge amounts of emotional baggage home with her which I don\u2019t think helps.\nThe reason for writing this is given the ineffectiveness of our local GP, I\u2019m really struggling to figure where to turn. She went to them 6 months ago saying that she needs help with her mental health and the response was essentially that the system is too full. Over the past year, she\u2019s spiralled significantly to the extent of drinking / vaping heavily, talking about her indifference towards living (including active self harming) and just generally struggling to get through day to day. I used to think (probably naively) that with the medication / my support, she would be ok but that evidently is no longer sufficient.\nIf anybody can steer me towards useful avenues to get help (private or public, at this point the money doesn\u2019t matter if something will help) then that would be huge. Unfortunately she\u2019s tried various therapists in previous years which were all unsuccessful and now almost has a mentality that she cannot be helped which is demoralising her even more.\nIf you\u2019ve got to the end of that then I can\u2019t thank you enough. I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do at this point and I\u2019m terrified that this spiral will end in her trying to end it.",

 "text": "I miss my TMI buddy I met someone online. We just really clicked right away. It was so nice. I like making new friends that I instantly feel close to. We became TMI buddies (we could talk about anything and everything, even stuff we wouldn't be able to talk about with other friends, cuz welll, TMI). I felt so free and happy because of that. \nI suffer from major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms, plus ADD somewhat and I warned him about that. He didn't care about that. Which made me feel good. But I kind of sabotaged our friendship. Feelings were involved, but he's married with children, so of course can't really give me much time, while I currently have no job, so have nothing to really focus on right now. I'm married too, which makes me a horrible person. I got depressed and needy, and I divulged too much and ended up texting him all the time, like throughout the day too, cuz idk, he would read them eventually anyway. It was too much for him of course, understandably. \nI ruined our friendship. All because of my craziness. I always get really stupid with guys. I wish I wasn't me right now. It hurts. I'm really hating myself right now. \nTLDR: I messed up my relationship with my TMI buddy because I got all crazy on him.",

If we are constantly on the edge of nuclear war or someother disaster to the point where it will have to happen eventually than why not pull the trigger now. None of us deserve to live or have the life we have and it is completely unsustainable and no one is willing to give it up for the greater good myself included. So why should'nt we all fucking get it, humanity will die but, the earth and nature will bounce back even if the world we know would be destroyed. I hate, this world, i hate where i am no matter where it is and most of all i hate myself for everything that i am. theres no escape from this i have nothiing to gain its all meaningless and i have to march through it everyday for no reason and it will never end until i die which could be decades away as my existence gets more and more unbearable unless i kms which won't fucking happen of course. My life is'nt even bad but, the person that occupied it very much is, as shitty as they get. My bitterness and hatred for myself and the world around is one the biggest culprits. Ive gotten to the point of hating myself where I hate everyone who does'nt hate me because in my book they are almost just as bad.\n\u200b\nI just hate everyfuckingthingandimsofuckingSick of it and i cant stand but i have to go through despite nothing ever changing or being accomplished. \n\u200b\nIve lost all motiviation all the things Ive wanted to do or make can be done better by someone else and now AI. which all take all the jobs in the area I want and make it impossible for me to obtain a job after college. I will be washing dishes my whole life and my degree and everything i have worked for so far and for the next two years will be worthless just like i am. its my own fault for ever having the ego to think i could be worth more than the shit on the floor no one bothered to fucking throw away because it just was not worth the effort. \n\u200b\nthe computers the AI will replace everything, anything that makes us human art, literature, drawings, human creativity of all kinds has been devalued out of existance there is not point of pursuiting anything because the things that made us happy and human are now nothing and we will all be consumed into the void with no escape in site, either that or we will be vaporized by nuclear warfare as if it even fucking matters anymore how we fade away from this sad stupid existance. \n\u200b\nNobody seems to see it, not one person ive met or seen seems to see what is going to happen everyone is just going through it as if they are not about to be replaced as if not every single person except the very wealthy will be replaced. in the old days they wanted many children not just becasue many would die to disease but, they needed a growing workforce to keep the engine of society running. Now that is gone eventually robotots, AI models, computers, drones, kiosks and all will replace those jobs and then the everyone will no longer be necessary or important. they will remove us in some way, in the best case by making sure we dont reproduce slowly depopulating us or in the more likely case finding someway to remove us in a more forceful manner. it wont  happen today tommorow or even very soon but, i believe before the end of the century or even by the 2050s.\n\u200b\nthe is no more point in continueing if i no for certain the world i will continue into will be worse than the one i already hate living in and i cant change i never will be able too nobody can no matter how nieeve of a person they are they cant change it. It was'nt any better in the past it never really was we just got good at hiding it. because it was never the physical pain of living outside needing to survie not having electricity, dying of disease, no clean water, no comfy first world life. no not in my diluded eyes, it was the pointless the void, the fact that the pain that is inflicted upon us that we are forced to endure no matter how miniscule first world problems they may be or man made horrors beyond comprehenion. we experience these for no reason, nothing, one day we will die, and maybe there might be some fun things along the way to hide the truths but ultimately the end will be same.\n\u200b\nunlucky for me i find little to no joy in anything anymore my mind is dull and slow and foggy except for void that will consume me completely one day with no hope of chainging it. maybe the fog is what prevents me from seeing what THEY see but, i feel that i this may not be the case. I just wish it would consume me faster or relieve itself and let me see what they see again but, neither will happen.\nI dont see anything in the furture anymore just foggyiness, nothingness, dread and fear at I will be forced to deal with despite having no energy or motivation to do so even thought they may not be bad things really in the grand scheme of things. My life is'nt bad i live a first world lifestyle things have been handed to me and ive never had to struggle in the way others have, never had anything horrible or painful happen to me. I am just simply weak even with life on the easiest setting imaginable i still struggle and fail at almost everything and manage to be completely and utterly incompetent, i will never i acheive anything, past highschool i have made no freinds and i most likely will reamain that way, im almost certaintly never getting a love interst, or girlfreind or whateever, im never going to create any of the things i have wanted to, nobody really likes although nobody truly hates me either, i will never have anything to add and I have no excuse for any of it.\n\u200b\nI cant stand this fucking shit anymore everyday it gets worse and worse, everytime i hope it will get better. I try to better myself everyday, i go the gym, i try to eat healthy elminating foods, i drink as much water as i feasibly can but, im constantly fucking thirsty, i take cold showers, i take supplements, i go to a phsych/therapist, i take medications. None make a difference, not longer than a few months anyways. and it just gets worse today my lower back and testicles hurt so fucking bad but, i can tell no one and there is nothing that can be done to solve it and even if there was why? one problem medical or physical, or life, or the car, or the computer or whatever the fuck problems just run into more problemss wo why even bother solving them. \n\u200b\nWe are going nowhere i dont understand where anything is going its just moving but, for what why i cant rap my head around because, in the end its just a question nobody has an answerer and not without a lack of trying. but, everyone else has distracted themselves with other things and moved on wither their life. But i cant, i dont think that i can, the dread, the emptieness, the hopelessness, the no will to do anything, the lack of joy, the lack of anything human and the lonliness of it all. I will be forced to go through it time and time again for nothing and no reason at all i hope the hand of god comes down wipese me off the face the earth as if that would ever happen. \n\u200b\nBut, it would happen if i ever found a way out of everything than that would be the day the world ends becasue thats how it alwasys fucking goes so why even try. I want to do it so bad i loathe those whome care because they make it so that i cant do it and the door will reamin locked keeping me in my chamber. I wish i could just do it anyways its not my fault they put thier eggs in a poorly woven basket. but i know that I wont because i would have by now if i could.",

The situation was a bit different then though. I broke up with my boyfriend and was alone, without work. Already then, I wanted to cut myself (I never understood why people wanted to do that...) but I was too afraid of sharp things (phobia). And I wanted to die. I fell in love with a guy who didn't want me and that was just another confirmation for me that I am worthless. \nI started therapy and freelancing. I was suecessfull. I gained quite a lot of clients and everything was fine until two weeks ago or something like that. I felt nervous about the idea of people dumping me and that I will end up poor again. Whenever I received bad feedback, I immediately started to cry. Today I received a devastating message from a customer that they don't want to proceed working with me. And then the urge of wanting to die started growing again. I had a knife in my hand but luckily I am still too afraid to use it (I 'just' wanted to cut myself again). I constantly think that people hate me and that I am stupid. I work full time and I do a masters degree. I speak 8 languages and still, I have the feeling of beeing worthless. I don't see the sense in my life or in life in general. Why should I go on like that? In order to lose everything again and again (I am in constant fear of something bad happening like losing all my clients) and that would be my biggest fear. Ending up in 2020 again.. If that happens, I really want to end my life. I miss my loved ones who passed away. I miss my grandma every day even though her death is 8 years ago. I still have her knitted socks here which I cuddle time and again. Life's just sad. Empty. I'm in the void again.",

 "text": "I'm at my wit's end with things and I see no good conclusion. Late last year I walked out of a retail job of four years due to blatant safety issues and apathy from management regarding said issues. While being burnt out and at my wit's end, I jumped right into a warehouse job just a couple of weeks afterwards. I was faced with several bullies and I was literally driven out of the place in less than three months. Both of these incidents sent me into a spiral, one resulting in me holding a gun to my head.\nThings have gotten marginally better and I've gotten a job working in a home improvement retailer. I thought things were great until these past few days. After three days of online training, aka staring at a screen for the entirety of my shifts, I've been told to work with a 'mentor' on the salesfloor to get hands-on experience. No one has been around to train me, and the times they\u2019ve been around, they conveniently disappear after sending me away with a menial task, leaving me to wander around not knowing what the heck I'm doing. \nToday, the guy in charge of hiring and basic HR duties expected me to go out, while not knowing anyone or their names, and track down a trainer myself. I found no one. Saturday is my first real day and nobody has shown me anything. I don't even know how to get into the building since I'll be going in before opening time. \nDue to my poor mental health I've viewed this job as a last chance. I burned my bridges at my two previous jobs and I refuse to go to other places knowing that I'll be faced with another bully situation which will harm me significantly. I have been doubting my ability to work without going into a spiral each and every time I start a new job.\nFrankly, I'm terrified. \nI plan on seeking out the overall store manager, a really nice guy, and explaining to him that everyone has been passing the buck on getting me trained in-person, and I've got no clue as to what's going on or what I'm doing. But I keep thinking about the likelihood of having to quit due to this unprofessionalism and then not knowing where to go or what to do for work. I'm kind of lost right now and between all the other impossibilities of this 'American Dream'\u2026 I'm not seeing much hope to be had.\nI'll never own a home. Rent is impossible to afford. Retirement is some kind of sick joke\u2026 the list goes on. This work nonsense is so small but it feels like this is it for me and I'm already on a path towards this last shot going up in flames.\nI just want someone to hear this. People have told me, to my face, that I'm lazy and incompetent and weak for all these feelings. It's getting harder and harder to maintain the will to go on. \nAm I alone with this?",

 "text": "How do I tell loved ones how I feel? I'll use my words carefully so as not to confuse people.\nI'm 21, I have ASD, social anxiety, insomnia, and probably passive suicidal depression. I say probably because I haven't been diagnosed or spoken about it with anyone, this is the first time. If I had to choose a few words to describe how I feel day-to-day, They would be grief, loss, regret, and apathy.\nMy dad was a deeply religious man, something that conflicted with my beliefs at the time, and because of this, I had become a little estranged. He also moved away and so I didn't get to see him as often. On my birthday, September 17th 2021, he tried to phone me. I didn't answer and let It go to voicemail. He sounded sad, alone, and depressed. Despite that, I still didn't call back. \nMy dad died on October 3rd 2021, It was sudden and not expected, he was 64. I pray that nobody feels what I felt that day. I cannot express the gravity of the grief, pain, loss, regret, anger and hatred I felt. Words can't describe It... And It's even stronger now.\nIn 2022 my mum was walking to work when she collapsed and suffered a stroke. She had to give up work, something that she loved. Since then I've slowly watched her depression get worse and worse. She struggles to do everyday activities due to what happened.\nThese past few years the only memory I have Is grief. I lost my Parrot George suddenly, my cat Milo, my dog Jenna, and then my dad.\nI feel empty, incredibly empty...\nThe truth Is, If I were to go to sleep and never wake up, I simply wouldn't care. I don't necessarily hope It happens, I just wouldn't care If it did. I'm going to seek help for it because I think I might have passive suicidal depression. I simply don't care about anything anymore. I've gone months without a shower, brushing my teeth, and years without leaving my home unless I have to.\nMy question Is how do I tell my family? I would tell my mum, and perhaps I should, but I fear part of the reason her stroke happened was due to the stress of grief she has felt, she has lost more than I have in recent years, and I'm scared that hearing how I feel about life will upset her greatly. \nWhat do I do? I know I need to speak with someone before It gets worse.",

We get to drink and party with friends.\nSadly my friends ended up all bailing me and my plan was we all go out clubbing and then we just have a kickback at a hotel. But with most bailing on me it just sucks with how expensive the hotel cost is.\nIt makes me feel so lonesome seeing others celebrating their 21st and im over here broke and with most of my friends just ditching me. I thought i\u2019d be the one being spoiled but instead its just depressing.\nI just dont know what to do, and even trying to cover a hotel cost now is so much without being able to split with friends. \nMakes me wish i had friends in college who cared about me and celebrating with me.",

Often times things happen and whether good or bad we move forth and usually it works out for the best. Keep your head up",

 "text": "Hey friend, I've had this same thought many times. Basically sums up to \"what's the point?\", right? And that is exasperating to try to answer. What I've personally found, when my depression lifts, I can see a point. I can see beauty and joy and hope and love in the small moments of life and I think \"well damn, it is worth it. Look at that beautiful smile on my son's face. Listen to that song, I can feel that in my soul. Wow, that is such a breathtaking view. My God, this pizza is to die for. Etc. And I mean it in those moments. But then depression settles back in and I literally can't remember what it felt like that made me enjoy those things so much that it makes the rest of the mundane shit seem worth it. And that makes me spiral. And I fight against myself and somehow I make it through. And my depression lifts and I can feel again. The cycle repeats. Eventually I've come to realize that when I'm depressed I've lost the ability to remember or feel that anymore so yeah its hard to rationalize and fight. It's like I've been submerged into a walking dream and I need to wake up to feel again. But every time I do. Even if it's just for a short time, I come back. Always with a struggle but I come back. I know it's hard to remember those moments when you're in the pit, the depression truly blocks your ability to feel it and remember, but just try to hold on through this season to get to the next good one. When you do get there, journal the hell out of every emotion. Or create art if that's something you do. Or make a video. But capture the essence of what you're feeling so that when you can't remember next time, you know why you're still fighting. The more I did this, the easier it was to fight through and bounce back. It's taken a lot of time, but I'm currently in my longest stretch of not wanting die after thinking this way for over 15 years. Stay strong my friend, try ti get to that next good season and jeep something around to remind yourself how good it feels to be alive, even when life is mundane. Give yourself something to fight for.",

 "text": "I need help I\u2019m a 22 year old male. So often lately, usually when I\u2019m alone or not doing something that takes much thought, I find myself overwhelmed with emotion and I break down in tears.  \nSometimes when I\u2019m not even thinking about things that make me sad. \nI used to never cry. Partly because it was embarrassing, and partly because I just never felt the need. Now I do it often. A few times a week out of nowhere. \nI think these are some of the reasons. I live with my grandma. I have no friends. I\u2019m overweight and borderline obese. I struggle to date because of my weight and physical features. I\u2019m a ginger and I\u2019ve been treated differently my entire life because of that. My life basically consists of being addicted to and binge eating fast food, working, paying bills, hating my job, trying to lose weight and succeeding for a month at the most and then falling back down into the same hole as before. \nI had an amazing friend group of intelligent people with good morals and goals, whom I pushed away because of shitty choices I made. I think I hated myself and my life so much, that I treated those who loved me like shit, and it resulted in losing everyone who was good to me. My best friend since high-school doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me and refuses to hear my apologies. I\u2019ve completely destroyed every meaningful relationship except for my parents. \nI\u2019m trying to change. To treat those close to me with respect and just be a better and more humble person. But I feel like I\u2019m suffocating. I\u2019m lonely. I hate myself. Nobody knows or cares how I feel. \nI often text the suicide hotline just to have someone to talk to. I don\u2019t want to die. I just want relief. I want friends. I want people who share my interests to talk to and have deep conversations with. I want to have people over and cook for them. \nI\u2019m not where I want to be and I\u2019m struggling to get somewhere better. \nI\u2019m sorry for the long rambling post. I need someone to talk to. Please help me.",

 "text": "Depression, infertility & growing up with disabled siblings Thank you for reading. I guess I'm looking to be comforted, heard and to see if anyone else out there has felt the same and did you get through? Both my siblings are non verbal and very disabled, to put a fine point on it my mother walked my brother in a harness because he couldn't understand not to run out in traffic or run off etc. He appeared normal to look at so you can probably imagine the immediate judgement cast upon my mum out in public and this is just a snippet of our daily lives. Growing up I couldn't even contemplate being a mother, like a knee jerk reaction to the thought of raising people like my siblings, I just couldn't hold the thought in my head for even a second, let alone allow the thought to enter into my head 'what if my children weren't disabled', the process never went that far. Fast fwd about 20 years I have a loving marriage and roughly 5 years ago we decided it was time to try. Bravely we tried naturally to no avail and I have since become steadfast in wanting to use donor eggs. What hurts me is the realisation that I've honestly never ever been able to think about or embrace the idea of motherhood as I feel so many other women get to. I never allowed myself to try and picture maybe our children would be ok, what a great father my husband will definitely be n how much I'd enjoy motherhood myself. I've realised how much I've had to hold my breathe and look away from the subject more or less my entire life. Its been a struggle, also convincing my husband to use donor eggs, we're still in the very early stages of this. I feel guilty saying this because I don't feel I could ever say it to him but I feel even approaching having children the natural way with me was a cruel expectation, how could someone have expected that of me? But then I remind myself it was me who grew up with the kid in the harness, the one who bashed his own head on concrete stairs, who I've never had one conversation with. He didn't grow up with that, I did. What's worse is my parents seperated and perhaps unsurprisingly my mum became a full blown junkie. I became estranged from my father and his side of the family after an argument when I explained we were going to try for kids soon. My parents, who are most knowledgeable on my situation have outright abandoned me. I'm furious with my father in particular it is surrounding the idea of me starting my family, there was no discussion about donor eggs or IVF he just ran like a coward and frankly I feel like this is when I needed my family's support the most. I can never forgive him for being such a hurtful coward. I pray to God we can start our family, I know it will heal my heart in a tremendous way and it's something we're definitely ready for but I can't help but feel a little ripped off by life, like a basic daydream was never an option for me and there have been huge expectations asked of me with no acknowledgement to how brave I was for even trying in the first place.",

I\u2019m really looking for a general answer to the question in the title, but I have explained a bit of my background below if it would help that you have a basic understanding of where my question is coming from so you could give a more specific answer given my situation.\nThanks.\nBACKGROUND:___________________\nI saw a specialist today as I have experienced symptoms consistent with severe clinical depression for the last 4/5 months, and he said that because I can still experience enjoyment, he doesn\u2019t want to jump to a diagnosis of depression, even though I told him all I could in the time I had and only scratched the surface, which he recognised. \nWhen I say enjoyment, I mean happiness when my team wins a big game pretty much. This is roughly once a fortnight and very brief, before I snap back to the misery of my reality. It\u2019s like a distraction. It\u2019s the same when I see friends, but a lot of the time when I see friends I wish I could just go home and be alone because socialising/hiding my pain is too tiring.\nHe said I should see a therapist for 6-8 weeks and see how I\u2019m doing then, but honestly I cannot imagine how someone could reach a much lower point than I have and still be living. 6-8 weeks for me feels like years away, as I cannot see very far into my own future.\nAm I right to be upset, or should I just trust the process? I am considering getting a second opinion, as I just don\u2019t think he understands what my every day is like.\nI\u2019m not trying to glorify my misery or play into it at all, and I\u2019m not just looking to get some meds, I just want my illness to be taken as seriously as I think it should, because I cannot continue for much longer in this way. I don\u2019t want to be dramatic, but everything I say in this post is just how I feel.\nThe best way I can explain my frustration is that I believe that if he could live a day in my life, he would understand how severe my situation is.\nAny/all replies are welcomed and appreciated. Thank you.",

This guy is 19 and goes to college in the state next door to me. Unavailable in both life circumstances and proximity. And so much of my mental health has been spent worrying about this guy and crushing hard and realizing it has an extremely slim chance of ever happening. And I, like you, don\u2019t even know this person very well. I too have so many emotions about that and everything else in my life. I have social anxiety as well.

 "text": "Venting to Strangers is Easier Than Venting to Friends/Family Anyone else struggle to open up to friends and family...? I feel like I'll burden them with the weight of my issues... or that they'll leave me because I struggle. I think it stems from the fact that it has happened before. People get tired or hearing my struggles and leave... which I don't blame them for, but as a result... I don't want to open up to anyone I'm close with. So, what do I do? I try bottling it up, but that only makes me numb. Once I get sick of being numb, I try to vent to strangers. It actually helps, only problem is if they want to become friends afterwards... they know all my problems now. It's a double edge sword. Unless I pick the path of being numb. Am I the only one who struggles with finding a good place to vent? I know therapy is a thing, but I've had bad experiences with therapists, plus it's expensive. So, what do you do?",

When I was a kid my dad passed away and I felt a pressure to be stoic and keep shit to myself, and then it seemed like I would be commended on how well I was coping so I thought that was what I was supposed to do. Then a year later I began showing the first signs of Tourette\u2019s and the idiot therapist I was seeing told my mom and stepdad that it was actually just a reaction to stress and that I could control it. I tried to tell people what was going on but they didn\u2019t believe me and forced me to try and overcome the tics, so there was 10-11 year old me learning that I could not tell people what was going on because I was seen as being dishonest. I was pressured to just not feel what I felt or to hide it away. \nSo now instead of saying anything to anyone I just keep inside. I have found some comfort in posting crap on here because I don\u2019t have any fear of being a disappointment, burden, etc. I\u2019m working on it though. I had a partner who was absolutely supportive and I just could not open up to her no matter how much it would have helped both myself and our relationship. I\u2019m starting to see how there are people I can open up to but it is a struggle. Working on it though. I don\u2019t want to be this way.",

I have had physical illnesses for a while now too, but without a formal diagnoses people tend to look at you like you're making it up or blowing it out of proportion... of course same thing goes for mental health in general. People don't believe you, because it's not something you can see. The fact that they said you can control it though because it's a stress reaction is wrong not only because it wasn't the reason... but because stress is not a reaction we can often control either. It's unfair to judge someone who cannot handle stress in the same way as someone else. Like for me... I actually have genetic issue that makes my body produce an excess of the stress hormone cortisol. Telling me to stress less is almost laughable, because medically in some ways I can't. xD \nPeoples judgment and their lack of trying to understand is frustrating to say the least.",

 "text": "Thanks. It was tough, and more than anything else I hate that it caused so many problems for me down the road. I went on Wellbutrin which actually wound up making my mental health way worse, but I just open up to anyone about how bad it was until I totally lost control. I became suicidal then abandoned my partner for a plan to run off and commit suicide. I was shaken out of my stupor and finally realized that the medication was actually the biggest root cause of my mental health struggles, but by then I had already screwed up the relationship. \nI\u2019m much better now but it\u2019s hard because we are trying to see if things can be worked out, and now I\u2019m in this tough situation where it\u2019s hard to open up to her because I caused her so much pain and heartache so I have to try and fight that urge to really talk about my own feelings as they relate to her. Here I am finally willing to share what is going on but I really can\u2019t talk to her in that way and it\u2019s just such a punch in the gut. I hate that I took so long to start feeling any willingness to share these things and it really stings to realize that I now have to keep it to myself for this other reason. I mean what I need to do is identify other ways to talk about this stuff with other people, but I feel this strong motivation to talk to her specifically. It was almost easier when I didn\u2019t want to share anything. \nAnd you are so right that nobody understands the fact that there are things going on inside that actually dictate your actions or behaviors at times. It\u2019s not that I want to escape any sort of accountability, I just want to feel like people are at least willing to think about the fact that it\u2019s not so easy to do everything the right way when your brain chemistry is totally out of whack. People just don\u2019t understand and it\u2019s so hurtful to realize that. I think about the fact that people told my former partner that I was just a liar and not to believe anything I was saying about what went wrong with me and it just hurts me so deeply to realize that. I\u2019m not a bad or dishonest guy - I was really fucked up and scared and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I desperately want to be normal and to feel like people don\u2019t dislike me or think I\u2019m a bad person and it\u2019s such a lonely and helpless feeling when people think otherwise.\nAnd I bet you hate it when people tell you to not stress out! I just want to grab people and shake them at times and ask them why anyone would actively choose to feel this way. I mean of course you\u2019d stop it if you could. Nobody wants to have this shit.",

I already judge myself enough for not being productive, when other people do it... it feels like twisting the knife that I already put in myself and driving it deeper. \nI completely understand where you're coming from with your ex. I've messed up relationships as a result of lack of communication. I had a very kind partner at one point and I wound up hurting him as a result of my dumb decisions and self sabotage. Our relationship was never the same after that... and I built walls that never came down.. I also had a bad time on Welbutrin... I actually began to experience psychosis... so that wasn't the greatest. But that's a whole other thing. The side effects of medications that people don't talk about. How the wrong medication can impair us drastically. Sometimes even turn us into a someone completely different. \nOnce again I am so sorry you have had to deal with all this. If you want someone to talk with about this and maybe lend some support, shoot me a dm. I'd be happy to chat back and forth and maybe I can support you along the way to possibly eventually be able to open up to your ex again. Best of luck either way. Sending virtual hugs. \ud83d\udc99",

So we are traveling around the country, lately I\u2019ve been thinking I need a home base for my mental health, he just finds rebuttals and would not stick by me because he says having a home base would harm his mental health. Am I being crazy hoping for after nearly 3 years of dating I thought he would be more supportive. I\u2019ve mentioned things that might help like an emotional support animal, maybe a hamster, but that would complicate moving so he\u2019s against it. He\u2019s also quiet so there\u2019s that. He just thinks that I\u2019d be just as lonely at home base. It feels like every day is so similar. A home base might be better with friends, garden, pet, art and music. \nTLDR: bf of nearly 3 years wants to travel around, I want a home base.",

It first became apparent when at 22 years old I started to experience gastritis and bloating, something that has never gone away. I think that it\u2019s all rooted in my childhood. When I was growing up I lived with my mum and 6 years older brother in the week. My brother was often not very nice to me and would be unpredictable. He would sometimes get angry and shout at me. it might be because I beat him at a game or it might be for no reason at all. I can remember being hyper-vigilant around him. My mum would also get stressed easily and would have outbursts where she would scream loudly in Spanish (she is from Venezuela). This was also scary for me as a child. On the face of it my childhood doesn\u2019t look too bad - my mum and dad were split up but I had regular contact with both of them and there was no physical abuse or anything. But it must be the reason for my anxiety, depression and insomnia. \nI am really struggling at the moment with insomnia and am often only sleeping 3 or 4 hours a night. Does anyone have any advice on how to get better? My sleep has been so bad for so long now that I think I\u2019m going to have to try antidepressant medication again. It was a long time ago that I took it but I feel that citalopram will suit me best. I don\u2019t want anything too sedating as I won\u2019t be able to concentrate properly at my job. I\u2019m not looking forward to the sexual side effects, feeling dull and the eventual withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively I\u2019ve been thinking of trying LSD but I\u2019m not sure that would be a good idea, it might not work and I\u2019ve already got visual snow after taking mushrooms quite a few times a couple of years ago.",

I read the rules of this sub but being new on Reddit I really am not sure I\u2019m really respecting them. If not, I\u2019m really sorry.\nI (21F) have been fighting depression for a long time now. It all started when I was nine, because of the loss of two of my close family members and the operation of my mom. I started self harm then, and finally stopped thanks to my therapist who I\u2019ve been seeing for the past few years, not counting some pauses. At 15 years old, I fell deep in a depressive state again, for no apparent reason. I got better. Then, everything fell appart again last year. I started to see my therapist, but for a few months now I get the felling that I\u2019m doing worst. I am really doing worst. I avoid going to class a lot, I don\u2019t hand in my assignments anymore, I don\u2019t go out, I\u2019m starting to skip meals or binge eat, I do not sleep or can\u2019t get out of bed.\nA few days ago, I cried all day. Usually, I get better afterwards. But the following morning, I felt just as drained. Two days ago, I had an anxiety attack in class. I decided then to talk to my parents, finally. We decided collectively to change therapist, and eventually to seek some type of medication, which I always refused.\nToday, I hit rock bottom, I don\u2019t know where to go from there.\n(TW : Self harm)\nI used to, as a child and until now, pinch/bite my arms and hands, or slap/bang my head against whatever was there. This morning, I noticed my boyfriend (22M) (I spent the night at his house) was freshly shaved. I went to the bathroom after he had gone to class, and took the razor blade and cut myself. I was extremely calm and lucid. I perfectly knew what I was doing. After I was done, I felt nauseous, I almost puked, I was trembling on the floor, my arm was burning. I managed to get up at some point and shower and get dressed before he got home. Since then, I am completely drained, I am desperate, I am lost.\nI always hoped to get better. But right now I question any positive thought like I never did before.\nI need support, help and advice from people in the same situation.",

In the past 5 years my symptoms have amplified and I just find lack of pleasure in doing anything at all.

 "text": "My dad keeps comparing his self-diagnosed depression to my professionally diagnosed depression. I'm a 16 y/o female, and I was professionally diagnosed with severe depression. My parents are divorced, and I live full time with my dad after multiple incidents with my mother, which destroyed our relationship.. not that there was much of one to begin with.\nSo I live full-time with my dad. He's a conservative, Christian guy, very firm and expressive with his beliefs.\nHe hasn't been diagnosed with depression or anything, but he says he was and has been depressed since the divorce, and maybe even before. I told him he should get diagnosed, but he said he didn't need to.\nHe constantly is comparing me to him. For example, he says things like, \"I'm depressed, and I've been brushing my teeth twice a day AND flossing. It's not hard,\" because sometimes I just can't work up the motivation to get up and do it. I'm not saying I never do, it just isn't every single day, twice a day. But it's not just that. He expects me to do all the laundry, minus his own- which means all towels and my siblings' clothes, along with my own (I have no problem washing my own clothes), do the dishes, take care of the animals (two cats and a dog), and cook dinner almost every night. He is constantly calling me lazy.\nRecently, I took several autism spectrum tests, and they all said I have a very high chance of being on the spectrum. I discussed those with my therapist, and she recommended going to see a specialist and getting professionally tested, because she agreed that I'm probably somewhere on the spectrum. I told my dad, and showed him the results, and his exact words were, \"You're not r#t@rded enough to he autistic.\" Like.. what?? I was shocked. He then went on to say that he used to think he had Asperger syndrome, but then realized he didn't, and that it was just his personality type. He also refuses to believe that I have ADHD, because I'm \"too lazy\" (his words) to have it, because it includes hyperactivity. However, my therapist agrees with me that I have it, and we're working on getting me diagnosed (she also has ADHD, so she keeps forgetting to test me lol.) She said that the depression can often cancel out the hyperactivity, as well as trauma-induced masking.\nBut yeah. Back to the main topic. I don't know how to deal with him. He makes me feel worse, more useless than I already feel. I haven't been eating properly, and I know that- I just don't feel hungry anymore. My suicidal thoughts are becoming more frequent, to the point where they're almost always on my mind. I've pictured my suicide many times in my head before- imagine different ways that I could do it, what it would look like, how it would feel, etc. I've even planned it out before, but something always ended up happening to prevent it, whether it be a friend talking to me, or realizing nobody would take care of my pets when I'm gone, etc. But I'm scared that eventually, something will happen that will push me over the edge- whether it's my dad putting me down, or a fight with a friend.\nI just feel like shit, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm sleeping more. I'm almost never eating. I'm getting lectured and yelled at and put down all the time. I feel hopeless. Is there any way to get him to understand? I've tried telling him what my therapist says, but he refuses to listen. What do I do??",

However, I\u2019m the only one making an effort, but I\u2019ve had enough. \nI\u2019ve significant health issues and in constant pain and struggle greatly to do most tasks. \nBut, I can\u2019t get him to do anything. He doesn\u2019t move all day, ignores me, makes disgusting messes. Whilst I do everything and fetch and carry for him. I\u2019m exhausted and my mental health is becoming really bad. \nI\u2019ve tried putting my foot down, encouraging him, but nothing. When I get really ill, he literally doesn\u2019t move from the sofa, he won\u2019t even make me a drink or feed himself. \nHe started sleeping in my room at the bottom of my bed 18mths ago. He literally doesn\u2019t let me have 10 minutes alone. It\u2019s suffocating. Nor does he let me sleep, I\u2019m surviving on 4 hours a night. \nI\u2019ve no one else, not a friend to talk too or help. I can\u2019t carry on living like this. \nI try every day to be upbeat, stay positive, encourage him, but I get nothing back. It\u2019s soul destroying and I\u2019ve literally nothing else to give. \nI have turned down 5 life changing surgeries as I can\u2019t leave him alone. \nI can\u2019t get any help from the Doctors.\nAny suggestions please?",

 "text": "So, I know a lot of people here will say not to see your PCP because they're not specialized in mental health. But here's what I did, and I've liked my experience so far:\n\nI started therapy in Nov 2021, with a licensed clinical social worker/therapist. (My friend recommended her to me.) At the time, I mainly needed help with my out of control anxiety. She helped me get a plan in place for my anxiety and depression (e.g., working through cognitive distortions, grounding techniques, breathing exercises, practical things I could do to build up a routine to counter my depression). But it became clear to us both that I needed to be on meds for depression and anxiety. So...\nI saw my PCP in January 2022. She diagnosed me with GAD and moderately severe depression. She started me on Lexapro. I checked in with her regularly about how it's going. And I still saw a therapist roughly twice a month. \n\nMore recently, in February 2023, I realized the Lex wasn't working as well for me anymore. So my PCP added Wellbutrin. And now I'm checking in with her on how it's going, as well, and still keeping up with my therapy.\nIf the Wellbutrin doesn't help, my PCP will refer me to psychiatry for med management. (But I'm keeping my fingers crossed she won't have to, because my PCP has been extremely supportive and I would like to keep seeing her for my mental health stuff.)\nSo my advice would be... if you decide to go through your PCP for meds, definitely make sure you're also seeing someone for therapy. And check in with both your PCP and therapist regularly about whether you feel your meds are working for you. They can help you figure out next steps.",

 "text": "I dont like myself I am a senior in high school in Canada and I have not felt alive since 2019 I used to be so outgoing and participate in events  and could start conversations with people on my own  and had so many friends were people knew as a nice and kind person that people can talk to  and during grade 8 in 2019 there was this girl that I met that i liked she was so special to me she was the first person I ever liked we met one recess where she was by herself and i asked what was wrong she shared her feelings the details were not important but i felt so great when she shared it to me we started talking and texting and facetiming like every day It was so fun we got to know so much about each other and i fell in Love with her even though we were just friends I told her I liked her she said she liked me but didn't want to date then I said I loved her she probably thought I was an idiot because how could you love someone if they don't even like you back well i did then I found out she liked my friend and this completely crushed me they didnt date but still this completely destroyed broke me she noticed she kept saying sorry and asking for forginvess and wanting to still be friends I accepted but we just argued all the time we were still close but it wasnt the same people during this time called me depressed cause i was sad that this girl didnt like me which was true I was sad even she noticed I even asked her to prom even after everything she said yes but a week before our grad she said no saying she didnt think it was right I should of known she didnt like me i should have enever asked garde 8 ended she left schools we still texted upto grade 11 then we stopped cause she I felt she was forgetting me and she would takes days to respond and even forgot my birthday multiple times and this made me das because at one point she knew me beter then myself it took me from grade 8 to grade 10 to finally get over her I cried myself multiple times to sleep thinking about her well atealst the sad music felt so good to listen to now. Sorry for getting off track , summer of grade 8 was great though I spent it with my friends and we even recorded youtube videos. They never got that many views but making them was an amazing experience that I will always remember. Grade 9 starts and I was scared which was normal but i was so introverted and nervous that I didn't talk to anyone I just assumed people would talk to me this never happened and on top of this I have really low confidence and my friends just started to call me to introverted and awkward which was true but I took it to personally and I let those words define me and sadly this is all I know and I still let it do for me they all made other friends and I was also no longer part of the group chat and parties but I know its my fault cause I distanced myself from them and other people in general but sometimes I tried to talk to people but covid came while I was in grade 9 and this did not help with my social skills I was alone i did the work and got good marks in th 80s but when grade 10 came i chose a bunch of useless courses that I thought were good cause of the youtube gurus in business so i chose them not knowing that they weren't good also grade 10 was also online so I was at home like 90% of the year and my parents wanted me to go outside but i didnt because I was terrified of finding people my age and having to inteact with them grade 11 came and it was in perons i went back and itw as the hardest thing ever cause U ahd spent the last years cheating and did not know that much and on top of that I had nobody to talk to my marks dropped and I hid in washrooms during lunch so i did not have to see other people I went back online for the second semester this was a huge mistake this is when I stared to get stress I would throw things and cut myself hit my head say horrible things to myself because I was tired i would even say Im going to kill myself to my parents My dad would get mad my mom would cry and I did not mean to make her cry or hurt but I still kept saying that and additionally I completely burnet my self out during the end of grade 11 and i am still recovering from it with heavy procrasanting and sterasing for any amount of work. But in the winter of grade 11 I started working at a grocery store were I met this girl and for five months I was so scared to talk to her or approach her but I wanted to cause I felt like we could of had something special and one day during the summer i heard a coworker saying she was going to leave the country  and then got the courage to talk to her so I did and for the entire week before she was going and it was amazing we did have a good connection but i t was to late she left and I was so disappointed I know I fall in love to fast and I know that I am selfish for wanting someone to love me and I can't even imagine someone saying I want you only you and wanting to spend the rest of their lives with me and saying I love you but I want that so bad to have a person love me the same way I would love them to only want to spend time with that person over everybody else to be someones favourite person but I Know that will never happen it took me very little time to get over this girl now for grade 12 it got worse I was now fully in person alone with bad marks and stressed spending lunches in a corner on my phone like an idiot I reconetd with some of my old friends but its never going to feel the same I still feel like an outsider and that our time has passed I even called the suicide hotline cause of uni appliactions and I was going to do it by jumping of a tall bridge near my school my mom wants me to go to therapy but i dont feel like I am deserving of that and also there have been some school shooting threats at my school but I still went to school hpoiing to get shot and killed and die a t a young age which I am still hopeing for.",

 "text": "Is this considered abuse? As a teen my mother accidentally broke my hand. I\u2019m 30 now & till this day I am not sure if it actually was an accident. Now they\u2019re together but at the time my parents were separated. My father living in his own apartment. One night my mom picked me up from a friends\u2019 & we started arguing on the way home. It was about them being so on/off during the separation. I was basically scolding her to stop behaving immaturely & to make up their minds as it was confusing my little brothers especially. She did not like this.\nOnce home I started walking down the drive way & got on my phone to call my dad as I didn\u2019t want to spend the night at my moms. She reached out for the phone but instead grabbed my pinky & yanked it hard a couple times. I felt cracks. I started running away down our street & my hand/fingers instantly became super swollen, purple, & throbbing. My mom claimed it was dark & that she thought she had a hold of my phone. \nI waited for my dad at the neighborhood marketa. It was late & the area with the only light. X-rays ended up showing fractures in my hand & pinky. I had a cast for some months. There is much more to the story but that is the gist of it. I don\u2019t recall what I told nurses, doctors, and teachers at the ER or at school. Nor do I recall what we told relatives. Why didn\u2019t anyone question how I was injured? Why didn\u2019t I think to call child protective services? I was probably thinking of my younger brothers & not wanting to leave them during such a tough time.\nEventually my cast came off & it became as though nothing ever happened. I\u2019ve brought it up since to inform my parents that this was one of the traumatic incidents that I believe has contributed to my depression now as an adult. Am I being dramatic? How would you deal with this now and then?",

I'm depressed because I've been through some complicated, hard times recently; I dont have almost any support in my life. \nI have seen a therapist for 6 months and it hasn't helped. I was hopefully at first, but now we have the same conversations week after week. We are starting to get frustrated with each other. I'm having a harder and harder time and he never seems to know what to say or do to help.\nI am hesitant to say anything about it to him again, or I think maybe he will drop me as a client. I dont want to go to another person because it is really hard to find people who won't just treat me like I'm diseased, and shove one size fits all CBT shit down my throat. I find that way of doing things very damaging to me. \nI have no idea what to do. Part of me thinks, maybe this isn't helpful anymore, but I don't want to stop seeing the guy and have no other options. I feel afraid and lost. I don't have anyone else to turn to.",

 "text": "My advice based on personal experiences and what I learned about me (40m) to make therapy beneficial to me.\n\nFind a new therapist ASAP, it isn\u2019t personal to them, you need to put YOU first.\nOutline what YOU believe you need and what will make you more comfortable in your sessions, then start looking up therapists online and read there bio and what they specialize in to try and align with one that maybe a better fit.\n\nExample: \nMale or female therapist?  Personally I\u2019m more comfortable speaking to a female.\nAge of therapist?  I\u2019m looking for a therapist that is prob 40-55 in age.  My thought process is they have been doing this long enough to have decent experience but not so long they are starting to check out.  They also are from a similar generation as myself and thus possibility of better alignment exists.\nIn some cases the look of a therapist comes into play.  Yes this is judge mental and doesn\u2019t apply to me BUT I had a conversation with someone a few years back that really stuck and gave me perspective.  I was speaking to someone else about therapy, this individual was frustrated with there body and post pregnancy weight loss struggles.  However, her therapist was a female that was very over weight, so she didn\u2019t discuss her weight issues and struggles with her therapist because she felt it was insulting to be \u201ccomplaining\u201d to a lady that was twice her size. \ud83e\udd14\n\nDuring your initial meeting with a new therapist outline what YOU NEED and EXPECT from the sessions.\nFor me, I need engagement, and I need to be challenged and pushed.  I don\u2019t need to sit on a couch and just \u201cvent\u201d and \u201ccomplain\u201d.  I need someone that is going to engage with me, push back and question me, and give me different perspectives.  If I don\u2019t get that, it\u2019s a waste of my time and money, and I\u2019ll simply stop going.  I learned this the hard way with prior therapist failures.\nFinally give it some time, if the first session is terrible and a clear red flag \ud83d\udea9 , okay, but I would encourage you to give it a few sessions to see if the fit could be there, but don\u2019t settle if it isn\u2019t right.\n\nI\u2019ve been through a few over the years, then I took a different approach.  I started looking in more of the private sector - therapists that are not tied to or covered by insurance nor reside in the medical setting, and wow, my experiences were drastically different.  The therapist I see now is amazing, well educated, aligns with my needs that make sessions beneficial, and really pushes and challenges me when needed.  The office setting is warm, comfortable, and inviting - I joked it\u2019s like what you see of therapy on TV shows one time, but it truely plays a roll vs sitting and talking to someone behind a desk in a medical office building.  Obviously the downside is the price, I pay $125 a session (1 hr) and schedule every 2 or 3 weeks, so that hurts, but I\u2019ll continue to make it work as long as I see the ROI.\nGood luck!",
