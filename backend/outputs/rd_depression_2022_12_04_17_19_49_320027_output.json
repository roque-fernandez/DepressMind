    "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

I considered going back to that program but realized a year later I still have their cookie cutter CBT/DBT curriculums basically memorized and have since started teaching my online friends how to do progressive muscle relaxation, paced breathing, mindfulness, what values are, stuff like that. Anyway I wish I had a more concrete plan for what I\u2019m doing next but for now it\u2019s just therapy every week as usual and trying to keep myself alive. Whoopie.\nOh, and now I\u2019m having cardiac issues and god only knows why. It might be because of medications I tried recently on top of the medications I\u2019ve been taking since I was a kid\u2026feels like I\u2019ve been punished for trying to feel better. Funny part is that the concept of having a heart attack or a stroke (obviously this is my anxiety thinking up the worst case scenario) and dying is actually terrifying and I desperately do not want this. How very ironic and annoying. Further proof that depression is bullshit and the void in my brain is more of an emo teenager than an the supervillain it makes itself out to be.\nThat should feel comforting but it actually makes me feel week. Like a grown adult getting beat up by a teenager. And to further add onto the irony is that one of the reasons I quit my job at the high school was because I was intimidated by the teenagers. Good lord lol. If god was real he certainly would have had a great and sadistic sense of humor.",

Celebrate your daily achievements by planning cheat meals, and even just walking for 15 minutes, writing down that u took 2 flights of stairs today, etc. to keep motivated. Best of luck!

    "text": "Sometimes I feel like I have built this elaborate framework to keep me together from day to day. And always a bit of the exterior material is coming loose. So I hurriedly go around sewing and nailing it back into place. And you would never know it to look at me - unless you catch me with my needle or hammer, making my repairs in some visible area. And you would think it's just one bad moment or one bad day. But it is always. \nYou don't understand the dark spreading blackness unless it has come for you, too. Much like a mother's love or seeing the northern lights, I suppose. You can describe it, poetically even, but you can't know it.\nI don't think of ending life. It is too beautiful in moments that seem like rare and beautiful butterflies, or the unexpected sight of a hummingbird in the garden or glimpsing a good friend in the next aisle of the grocery store. \nIt just takes so much effort to beat back the waves. And when you have children who are growing and taking after you in the worst possible ways, you will throw them your life preserver, you will bail out their boat as you cling to its side. Anything to keep them afloat, no matter what it costs you.\nToday my skin is an electrical wire, pulsing and crackling with surges of power that threaten to electrocute anyone who tries to come too close, to cross the border into the real me. It is exhausting. It literally drains me of my power. I am helpless until it threatens my dearest ones, and then I stagger back to my feet to hold it back once again.\nFor those who don't understand depression, I am grateful you have the ignorance. For those who do, I hope you are able to fight it back, day by day, in a war that takes you into old age. There will be battles lost, such as tonight, when there is nothing left to give, when the reserves have been used up. I know a few tricks to turn the tide, but I will not be able to remember them in the dark. Perhaps in the morning I can pick up a weapon. I just have to make it to morning.",

    "text": "I was wondering if I\u2019m alone in feeling like my life is some kind of Truman Show, and I feel like my misery is comedy to something that has been interfering in my life forever. Whenever I get something that gives me hope somehow it\u2019ll fall through and it really feels like a joke. Especially when it happens over and over again. I\u2019m so tired of being disappointed with everything. I just want one win because then I\u2019d feel like maybe things aren\u2019t being sabotaged or controlled and my days are finally looking up. There\u2019s just no balance in my day to day life. It\u2019s making me feel like I\u2019m going crazy. I\u2019m just finding it harder and harder to convince myself it\u2019s worth fighting on. If I gave an example of some of the weird things that have been happening to me it would sound stupid and tedious. But the amount of times they happen and especially when they seem to happen. I stopped praying because every time I did my problems would intensify to the point where I was having panic attacks. I keep reassuring myself it\u2019s in my head, I\u2019m just being paranoid but it\u2019s getting harder for me to rationalize some occurrences. I feel like the world doesn\u2019t want me to be happy or comfortable in life and there\u2019s this unstoppable force making sure of it. Am I the only one? Does anyone else feel like they\u2019re cursed? I can\u2019t keep going through this everyday, it\u2019s been going on since 2008 and I don\u2019t think I can keep my life on track if I can\u2019t snap out of it or it just finally stops. I decided awhile ago that 40 years of pain and suffering from a birth defect, too mental illness and ptsd from all sorts of messed up crap in my life was long enough. I have really been trying to improve my life. I started exercising regularly. I started eating better. I still have trouble sleeping but I tried everything for that and I gave up. Nothing has changed. It just stays at the same depth in the abyss.",

So I've started preparing a little bit to switch jobs; I bought some interview and hopefully future work clothes, and bought some new like toiletries so I can try to make my appearance look a bit nicer so I could make a good first impression when I start going to interviews. That was putting the cart before the horse though and today, even though I woke up in a shitty, unproductive mood, I decided to finally bite the bullet, update my resume, and send out my first applications. At the very minimum I wanted to send out at least one, but my resume's gone. Google Docs said it was deleted. I didn't delete it. I don't have a backup of it anywhere and it deleted itself longer than 30 days ago so I can't recover it from the trash. I was thinking I should just start over anyway, but not even having my old one to reference is really demotivating. Especially since now having to start over from nothing is making me realize I remember almost knowing about how to use Microsoft Word. I feel so roadblocked and I didn't realize I'd lost so much competency with something as basic as Word and I want to cry and crawl back into bed",

    "text": "I'm back from holiday and I had to start work the next day instead of having a week to recover because I prolonged my holiday on a whim in what I call my big financial suicide.\nI went on this particular holiday on a cruise because I found out it was the only place where I don't feel like crying my eyes out all day. At least not every day. It does work pretty well, even without antidepressants, although it is not sustainable.\nSo Tuesday was my first day at work. I lost the last one because I couldn't even function enough to do my job anymore. Now I realise how much I messed up. My job was easy and boring. I complained about having to go there once a week and wasting 45 minutes in commute. I never took advantage of the unlimited holiday because, up to very recently, I thought I would just stay home feeling even more depressed and just doing even more of nothing. \nWell, now I have 1h30 of commute that is going to cost me a fortune. The job is very challenging but doable. That's what I used to thrive for but not anymore. The coworkers are extremely friendly and welcoming. I'm overwhelmed by the smells and sounds and I just spend the day trying to pretend and not collapse in tears until I'm at least out of the second train on my way back. I don't even feel like buying my sorrow in fries and chocolate like I used to do after a rough day. Now it's straight to bed and crying.\nI'm thinking of other holidays. A horse trek in December that I used to dream of but that I mostly want to do to avoid being around friends and relatives for Christmas and New year's Eve and also to be away from my pain again. Last night, I found another cruise to Scotland, Iceland and Norway. It's 14 days in summer and it costs more than I paid for my car. It is completely unreasonable and if I ever get better, I will probably want to come back in time to slap me in the face for wasting all my money like that just to hurt less for a while. I used to be very thrifty. Trying to save up for the future and my big dreams. I don't have dreams or plans anymore so what's the point? I fantasize about making the most of it, then just killing myself on the last day. I have researched a pain free method.  I'd just need a nice remote comfortable place away from everyone. Not on the ship of course, that would be insensitive.\nMy mother still has dementia and hounds me because I don't call her enough but when I do, she forgets. I have a wonderful lady who's been like a mother to me for the past few years. Now she's the one who needs help going through a divorce. Unlike me she likes having company and going out. I go out with her. She's often at my place. I want to help. I feel like it's my duty. But somehow giving affection costs me a lot these days. I've come to the conclusion that what's really bothering me if that we are starting to reproduce the same relationship I had with my mother who always told me that God has put me on this earth to comfort her. It doesn't help that on Tuesday, two different people assumed she was actually my mother despite us not even being of the same race.\nI need to discuss all this with my shrink whom I was supposed to see for the second time today, but I had to cancel because of a work meeting. I don't have another appointment for two weeks. I'll see where I'm at then.",

I'm not abusive and never could be, she left because she was cheating and I knew about it I just couldn't kick her out because I needed help watching him so I could work to provide for his needs. So its just He and I because she left pretty suddenly I lost my job and Spiraled.\nRan out of money pretty fast, I can barely afford to buy basic necessities, everyone who I live in proximity to who always says I'm here if you need someone to watch him while you work (For free because I cant afford to pay for a babysitter , and got denied for government assisted child care) but they always seem to be busy or change their minds and cant so I am pretty much stuck unemployed for the moment, I started my own company that I was told by a family member they would help me get moving, they didn't. I failed out of college because a friend committed suicide. I have a lot of pent up anger I am constantly unloading on those that deserve none of it. I yelled at my 3 year old for crying because my fuse is getting short. and now I'm sitting here crying in person typing this out because the one person who is stuck in my life with me, who Is my purpose for living gave me a look of terror because I screamed at him. He was shaking with fear because of me, my own son is scared of me, and I cant find time to myself because I'm all he has and he's scared of me. It broke me that he looked at me as if I was something horrible.\nHe doesn't understand why I am mad. I am angry at everyone getting to have help when I cant even get it from his own mother or any of my sisters, I'm unemployed other than my company that has no cash flow, People treat me like I'm lazy but aside from being on medicine for my depression I'm also taking meds for my ADHD which when mixed with the lows of a depression episode basically makes me go into a mind paralysis and I physically shut down. I can barely afford to provide for him which the only way I do is by begging for money from my father and money I have stolen from family without them knowing.......... Yeah I'm a Piece of shit but I'm all he has and Id die for him and he's the only being I feel love for anymore and  I intend  to build us a life I hope he can be proud of me as his father. That is all I want is to take care of my son and to show him I love him.",

He's going to be 70 soon and he doesn't want to pass away without leaving me anything. It really hurt deep to my core when he told me that. That's supposed to be his retirement money that he worked hard for for decades. I feel so sad that I couldn't make something of myself and give my parents a better life. Instead they're taking care of me well into my adulthood, to the point I don't know how I'd survive were I to lose them.

    "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d.

As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker.

That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.\nFor the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.\nNow when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much can't do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.\nWhich is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.\nI don't start PM's.

It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

But about 3 days a week, I have the entire day to myself and do homework usually. I always have to have the TV/ music on the whole day because it makes me feel less lonely and when it gets quiet, dark thoughts come into my mind. This has been going on for months now, every day off I sit in the same spot on the couch and turn on the tv while doing homework and try to forget how lonely I am, and wish I had a boyfriend or friends to be with me while I do homework. I won't talk to anyone all day and sometimes talk aloud to someone as if they are there, like extreme daydreaming. If I don't get myself out of bed I will sleep till about 6 pm. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and feel I have so much to get done the anxiety and fear of life stops me from getting it done , I wish I wasn't alone. And I wish there was someone to hold me and say I'm doing a good job. Sometimes I hate being alive, but from the outside , no one could imagine the kind of thoughts I think based off what I look like and how I act. I thought it was just a habit I have of keeping the tv on while studying, but I realized I worry about what my mind will say when I'm left without the sound to focus on and occupy my mind",

I think I am intergender (i wasn't told, I  never asked, don't really care to ),  all I know is my birth certificate says male,  my brain is all male but my body is not.  i am 5 foot 6..when i gained weight i grew breasts,  although male , i am well below average downstairs.. i get called ma'am often when I am at check outs etc.,  each time its like a knife in my heart,  Loneliness caused me to get fat, so fat i became bed bound for a decade, I nearly died, spent 50 days in intensive care,  then I found a weight loss surgeon, I lost 80 pounds to earn surgery,  had it,  then ended up losing a total of 440 pounds,  I went from 640 to under 200 pounds in under 2 years. It was not easy, I put in gargantuan effort,,  following that i went through 6 skin removal surgeries, the most painful time of my life with hundreds of stitches ,, during one of those surgeries I had a complication and had to go to a local hospital,,  while there a nurse decided to change my gender in my medical record from male to transgender without consulting me..  she looked at me and assumed, .   after a day of all the staff  calling me ma'am or miss  i finally got pissed off and asked what the fuck was their issue,,, when they told me what they did it was like a bullet in my heart,  I was just done,   when I am so physically feminine a woman thinks i am a transgender there is no longer any point in fighting to be a man  and going through as much pain as i was when my only goal was to become good enough for someone and to not be lonely .any longer.  It hit me like a ton of bricks,,, being fat did not make me pathetic to women,,,  i was fat and pathetic all along,  nothing i can do will change that and i am going to die a pathetic worthless virgin. I have to exist with that knowledge somehow,,   I feel intense jealousy of  people who have done nothing to me. they just have to  exist and be happy its not fair to them and I know it, , i hate that feeling but my mind is completely obsessed with love, sex, companionship  like im stuck at 14 years old,   i find it much easier to isolate myself from everyone and deal with the loneliness rather than be out there being pathetic,,,   i know I am sinking deeper, I feel it , soon too deep to breathe  but at least here i am not seen , my eating is getting out of control and i am gaining weight again, I wish I could stop that at least.   i would like to know what i did to deserve this life and really really hope i am serving my sentence adequately so I don't have to do it again , reincarnation is my biggest fear,,, i don't want to come back.  I am convinced saint peter does not guard the gates of heaven,, he is the jailer who lets us out of the prison called life if we earned our credit so don't cheat it and just suffer through the punishment, am I crazy for thinking I am sad not depressed since I have valid reasons for my negative moods?",

    "text": "I'm out of steam I don't know if this is the right place for this but I need to get this off my chest. I'm going to just lay it all out. It's basically my entire life story so bare with me.\nI was physically and emotionally abused my entire childhood by my narcissistic father. Basically if I wasn't being ignored by both of my parents I was being beaten or yelled at by my father. \nHe used to raise Great Pyrenees. We had about 30 of them at any given time and so one of my jobs was to care for all these animals my entire upbringing. As well mow end do the upkeep on 10 acres of land. Not going to say it was as hard as working on a farm but it was hard work. He cared more about those dogs than anybody in our family.\nMy first memory is being brutally beaten by him because he handed me the leash of one of these 120 lb dogs to 2-year-old me and expected me to be able to hold him. When the dog inevitably got away it was of course my fault. The one and only time in my entire life I can recall my mother standing up for me. Said I was never going to do it to this one. (I have three older brothers) I guess it wasn't that important to her.\nSo it was just things like this for 19 years. Harsh, confusing punishments. Lots of physical abuse. Lots of emotional abuse. Lots of forced servitude. I was taught that I was not worth a damn and my only value was in serving other people. So I ran out the door as soon as I graduated high school. \nHooked up with some crazy girl who most likely was schizophrenic. Regardless she was definitely an addict and turned me into one too although it didn't take much work. 5 years of abuse from her. Basically the same thing over again from my dad. Not really surprising that's just how these things go typically.\nShe of course cheated on me the whole time. Lied gas lit manipulated. You know all the usual tricks. Ended up leaving me for another man after 5 years with our 2-year-old son. So here I am 23-year-old me with a 2-year-old son and no one to help me so I go home. Cuz it's the only thing I know to do.\nSo for another year he really worked me over. Made it so that I had no money or car. Fairly certain he meant to raise my son as his own because I was just a lost cause at that point. He did such a great job with all his other kids right? /S\nSo in my horrible state I started looking around for a way out. And I'll admit that I was looking for a mother for my son. Which looking back on it with what I know today was probably not what I should have been doing.\nMet a woman who was wonderful. She was the sweetest, kindest person I'd ever met. Genuinely kind and loving towards me and thought I was the greatest and told me it all the time. She was in graduate school on her way to becoming a college professor. I was smitten. \nShe ended up helping me out of a really terrible situation with my family and was the catalyst that allowed me to change my life. I owe so much to her for that and so does my son. \nShe ended up not finishing her doctorate. I've always felt incredibly guilty because I feel like me and my son probably were the catalyst for that. Whether that's true or not at this point is unimportant as it's been 20 years at this point.\nWhen she left school we moved to be with her parents. EVERYTHING changed. She became incredibly childish. Stop working stopped helping out around the house just basically expected everything to be done for her. I assumed it was depression and it probably was. I was patient.\nWe ended up marrying. Been married now for 18 years. She never held down a job. She still doesn't clean the house. She doesn't help me with anything that needs to be done. She won't even make phone calls for herself. She has allowed me to take on every single responsibility in this home. \nOh, and she also had online affairs (nothing physical) TWICE. The second time was a time when I had two jobs and was in therapy for my depression. The only reason we stayed together after that was because my daughter had just been born a year earlier.\nI love my kids more than anything and I would literally do anything for them. It's the only reason I'm still with her at this point. \nWe found out about a year ago that she's most likely autistic. It explains a lot and I hoped finally that we would have the answers that we needed to start moving towards a resolution and possibly a better life for us.\nEverything got worse. I've been trying to get her in to see somebody and to get a diagnosis but I literally have to stand on top of her to get her to do the things needed to do. It's like having a third child.\nNow she sleeps everyday till 12:00 p.m. gets out of bed at 2:00 p.m. goes out to the living room and climbs into a large bean bag that we have and stays there until 11:00 when it's time to tuck my daughter into bed. Then climbs back into the bed. \nShe is a contractor who does editing but she can only work when she is in the right head space. These are her words. She made over 35,000 last year. This year she's made 10k. Financially our whole family is underwater. \nDoing my best to keep everything under control but I think I'm going to have to take a second job again. I held two jobs for the past 20 years to support the family. I also put myself through graduate school. I finally worked my way up my career path to the point where I make a good amount of money. Coupled with what she was making we had plenty of money. \nSo I'm not really sure why she stopped working but now I'll have to pick up her slack yet again. \nI'm exhausted. \nI hate myself.\nI feel like I deserve all of this.\nI don't think I love her anymore.\nDefinitely don't want to have sex with her anymore.\nI can tough it out till my daughter's 18 but that'll be 7 years from now and I'll be in my '50s. \nI'm so alone",

    "text": "I feel that my family, friends, and society would be happier if I just had the courage to die Hey everyone,\nJust a burnt out shell of a human being that was given all the advantages that you can think of in life but pissed them all away. I feel I need to die to atone for my sheer waste.\nI am a 23 year old final year engineering student. Recently, I failed one of my university courses and as such, my graduate offer working on space systems was rescinded.\nThings weren't always like this. Once upon a time I was actually seen as a role model and someone with a profound level of potential. In high school I won a state drone high school competition in 2016, joined my high school's inaugural model rocketry team in 2015, won second place in a state science competition in 2016, had a girlfriend in 2017, and went to formal (Australian for prom). I also graduated in the top 8% of high school graduates across Australia. I looked to space as my future career path and I fondly remember a warm summer night looking at the moon with a telescope and noting how many craters I can see.\nIn first year university in 2018, I had a falling out with my friends and my partner (which was my fault) and as such I lost sight of my dream for space. For that year, I dabbled in far right politics before I left due to my self disgust. I also almost got kicked out because of poor academic performance in the following year. I feel even for this alone, I deserve to violently and painfully commit suicide to gain the forgiveness of the people I hurt.\nLate 2019, I rediscovered my passion for space after meeting a former astronaut who gave me some words of encouragement. I turned my grades around and made some new friends through my university\u2019s rocketry and astronomy clubs. During the pandemic, I made a startup idea which I sold to a large energy utility for cash, mentoring, and a paid internship which lasted until mid this year.\nMiddle of this year, I was offered a role developing space systems for the Australian government. I was ecstatic, seeing that all my efforts were starting to generate results. However, as it happened I lost this offer because I recently failed an exam.\nI feel if literally anyone else had the same advantages as I did, they would become a billionaire and that I uniquely wasted what I was given. I really do not see the value in my life considering the epic wastage that I did (and continue to do).\nTo compare, I have a friend who also recently attempted suicide but thankfully was unsuccessful. His life has significantly more value than mine, being a software developer for a bank (which fits his passion for computers and finance), having a family which loves him, and having had many one night stands with women. I wished I can just take his pain away and absorb it so I can die. Society would be better with someone that can actually contribute like he does. I am a fucking waste of oxygen.",

I made a friend online about 8-9 years ago after I dropped out of college because of depression. He lived across the country and was much older than me (he was about 70 y/o) but he was always there for me when I was depressed or needed advice. No one in my real life knows he exists because I knew I'd never meet him and I didn't know how to explain to my friends that I have a 70 year old friend that I talk to about my depression (something my friends don't know about or know very little). The only one that kind of knows that he exists is my mom because he would send me birthday/Christmas cards but she knows nothing about him. He's been dealing with a lot of health problems ever since I've known him but he's always made it through.\nI noticed he disappeared off facebook for a couple weeks after wishing him a happy Thanksgiving, which was very unlike him. About another week goes by, still no answer from him and deep down I knew something was wrong. I tried not to worry about it because I had no evidence of him actually being gone so I figured it wasn't worth worrying about. Last night, his family posted that he passed and I basically lost it. I've never lost a friend like this before. I just can't comprehend how someone with some much life can be there one day and gone the next. I'm crying so much writing this, I usually deal with my anxiety and depression by avoiding but this is something just just can't be avoided; I'll never speak to him again. We used to speak everyday but in the past couple years, we only spoke a every couple of weeks, which I was fine with but now all I want to do is talk to him every day again.\nThe way I'm emotionally responding to this worries me so much because when someone like my parents die, I don't know how I'm going to deal with it; idk if I can. How do you guys deal with loss, esp when it's that of a friend that knows more about you than anyone else? I thought I would wake up this morning after crying all last night feeling a little better but I don't. Thank you for reading.",

However, I am also happy that you had such a caring and wonderful friend in your life, and one that understood you so well.\nI understand the feelings of anxiety around the deaths of loved ones. It's a constant fear that keeps me up some nights. \nThere was a period in my life where I didn't have many friends, or none at all, and I befriended my grandparents. First my grandfather died, then a few years after, my grandmother also passed. I was abroad when my grandmother passed, and it nearly killed me that I couldn't be there for the funeral.\nTheir deaths made me paranoid that I would find a loved one dead, either my parents or my siblings. I'd constantly be checking to see if people were still breathing as they slept.\nTherapy helped. It helped that I could speak to someone that couldn't share what I was feeling about them both, and about my anxieties too. But what also helped me was doing things alone, and being with myself alone \u2014 going on long walks, wandering around different cities or my own town, and taking in my own silence.\nDuring the days where I felt at my worst, I'd write letters to them both. The little things that made me miss them, the conversations that we hadn't gotten to, anything I wished I could have told them I'd write down.\nIt's very difficult some days. And other days, I'm so happy that I was able to be a part of their lives, as they were a part of mine. It felt like such a short time, but the time spent together \u2014 no matter how far apart \u2014 mattered.\nIf you want to share anything about your friend, or anything at all, I can offer a friendly ear.",

I hate this shit.\nSeeing people actually comfortable with showing their faces is completely bizarre to me. I don\u2019t get it. I wish I could be that confident. I feel so disgusting. I can\u2019t even look in a mirror. I haven\u2019t taken a photo of myself since I was a kid and avoid them at all costs. It sucks.\nI just want to be normal. No one will ever love me. I feel like people see me and they point and laugh. I\u2019m tired of feeling unlovable. I wish I looked normal so I could at least blend in with everyone else, but no. I stand out like a sore thumb. Fuck me. I want to fucking die.",

Getting a companion pet/dog is a good way to stop focusing on your perceived flaws and instead focus on taking care of something that will love you unconditionally. All the negative thinking compounds your stress levels, and that can fuel acne even more. So try to have some compassion for yourself and give your body and mind the chance to rest and recuperate.",

I have scarring literally all over my face, expect for around my eyes. I hate going outside, I hate being seen by my family, I hate that I spend so much time fussing over how I look and doing a complicated skincare routine just to stop things from getting worse. What I will say is that more often than not people don't even think about it when they talk to you, and it's probably the last thing on their mind when they think about you. One of my best friends in high school had very severe acne, and I literally only thought about it when he talked about it with me, but even then it's not something I remembered about him until I had severe acne myself and I remembered him talking about it. I know it sucks a lot and contributes to low self esteem and depression, but in my experience people tend to look past it. I hope you find a treatment that works.",

Go to the mirror, see yourself in it and say \u201cI\u2019m sooo freakin handsome!!\u201d Until a smile automatically pops out! I know it sounds weird but it\u2019s a fact that smart people talk to themselves in the mirror too!\nJust by the fact that you are waking up in the morning and getting off the bed, it\u2019s a huuuuge step!! You\u2019re in the right path! Just be patient with yourself, don\u2019t be harsh, if there\u2019s anyone in this world who is never gonna let you down, that is YOU. Please remember that. \nAcne is temporary like everything else. My brother had a really bad acne case thru high school. Everybody called him names like \u201cthe moon\u201d because he was full of craters (scars) and girls would make fun of him and his self-esteem was on the floor but one day I introduced him to one of my friends and she fell for my brother. She begged me to set her up with my brother in a date. I laughed because I thought she was joking but she never looked so serious. So I set them up and they\u2019ve been together ever since! Married for 5 years, together for 16 years! \nI\u2019ve always said, we live in an endless world of posibilites, so it\u2019s up to us if we\u2019d like to try our luck!\nI know depression and anxiety are so hard to manage, I\u2019ve had them for some time now and unfortunately haven\u2019t been able to get rid of them successfully (even with therapy and meds, but everyone\u2019s case varies) so my advice is, when you are at your highest point, when you feel great, make the most of it, because it\u2019s like a roller coaster, sometimes you\u2019re up and then down and then up again. It is what it is I guess.",

The fact you've carried this burden of feeling unlovable with you,  shows extraordinary strength. \nIts not natural to feel unlovable - you were born lovable and belong here, as much as the rest of us. Feeling the opposite, everyday must be exhausting. It's not your fault society is obsessed with image to a ridiculous level.
