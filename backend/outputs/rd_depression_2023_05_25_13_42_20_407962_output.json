 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

 "text": "My sister blew me off for the third or fourth time in a handful of years last week.  I finally got the courage to tell her that I was pissed and hurt and now I think she's mad at me.\nSo fuck it.  It takes 30 seconds to text me to tell me you've had a horrible week and need to reschedule, but she didn't.  I altered my whole week to accommodate her and she couldn't be bothered to send a simple text to let me know it wasn't going to happen.\nI am sick and tired of people looking down on me, I'm sick and tired of people not respecting me.  I know I'm not much and don't lead an extraordinary life, but god damn it, I'm a person with feelings.  I get angry, I get sad, I get hurt, I'm allowed to feel those things without \"getting in trouble.\"  I'm tired of being the bitchboy in the family because I'm the youngest, being looked down upon because well, she's amenable, she'll do it when it's convenient.  Well, yeah, I can, but it doesn't mean it doesn't affect me.\nI'm not a monster.  I could understand you had a shitty week and it wasn't going to happen, but I'm a person with a life and feelings.\nFuckin' hell.",

I got called weak by my own mom for not knowing what to do when i was in a toxic relationship and all i asked for love from my parents and thats another reason why my mom called me weak. My dad doesnt want any part of showing emotions and just say deal with it. My older sister is the same way and im very shame to call a therapist because im not ready to share the other info i have because i feel embarrassed for being depressed. And i dont want to bother my friends because they are already dealing with their own things and i just dont want to be a burden to them.",
