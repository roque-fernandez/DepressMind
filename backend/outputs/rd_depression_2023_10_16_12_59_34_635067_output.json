 "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\nSummary\nAnyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them. \n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\nBy posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \nPeople who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \nIf a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \nIn our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \nWe all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\nIf OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.\nIn addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.  \nIf you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when \"we want to help\", what it means is that \"we want to feel helpful\".  \"PM me any time\" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.",

I\u2019ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   \nAnd even as I didn\u2019t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren\u2019t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  \nIt is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. \u201cPM me anytime\u201d isn\u2019t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don\u2019t deserve the time and attention.  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP\u2019s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with \u201cPM me if you want to answer privately\u201d. Now OP won\u2019t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn\u2019t initiate a conversation \u2014 it has already been initiated. As you said, it\u2019s better not to offer to PM and as it\u2019s a rule now nobody should do it \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where \u201cPM me\u201d is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers\u2019 problems.",

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement.

It happens sometimes at my IRL crisis line, most often because they've never had a supportive conversation before they talked to us, so they kind of \"imprint\" on us (we literally call them \"ducklings\").  It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that \"only X can help me\" and also that \"X has what I need\", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but \"PM me anytime\" does both those things.  \n\nThere is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people not in crisis.  We harm people by not disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don\u2019t know who you are helping. You don\u2019t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don\u2019t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don\u2019t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\nBut as I said, you don\u2019t know who you are helping and they don\u2019t know you.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",

I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.  \nThere are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.  \nThere are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.\nBut I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the \"developed\" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.  \n\nI'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.\n\nAre you truly \"negative\"?

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

I\u2019m still trying, but it seems as if it\u2019s not enough. \nToo rational, too cold, too calculated, even more than before. I don\u2019t and can\u2019t subscribe to the \u201cthings will magically work out somehow\u201d mentality. That\u2019s not how I live. There's so much luck you can have before it runs out. The fact that I have a roof over my head and can still support myself now is because I had an exit strategy back when I started college in case I wouldn\u2019t want to continue with the major after graduating, not because some mysterious being pitied me and decided to help me. Guess I\u2019m still bitter over those thinly veiled dehumanizing beliefs I was fed with, which now looking back on this, were not subtle at all. How could I not? All you can see was how I went from being a fundamentalist to an ex-religious in less than two weeks, two months, or three months. But how would you have known anything about the process that led up to it, the struggle, doubting, questioning, fighting and deceiving myself, and leaving the foundation, the things, the people who I held dear most to my life? I\u2019d already left my family of origin\u2014the first people who were supposed to love and accept me. Of course it\u2019d stink the second time. \nPerhaps being empty-handed is a good thing. There\u2019s no meaning to anything. No sign. No fixed future destination. Which is exactly why I\u2019m free to do anything. Be a good person because I wanna do it, not because of the desire of eternal rewards. Allow myself to slip up and not constantly thought police myself.   \nIsn\u2019t this freeing?",

I have no distraction; media helps at times, but then I'm back to reality, back to the pain. I am currently unemployed and looking to apply to multiple jobs, but barely hearing anything back or getting a fucking interview makes me just want to throw in the towel. I wish things were different, and I wish I was different, but I'm not. Everything, even the smallest event to others, is amplified to me. I am pushing because I genuinely want to reach peace one day, but the work to get there is just mentally and physically tiring. I've isolated myself from a lot of people and definitely ruined friendships and relationships because I'm rotting inside. I don't want to go out to hang with friends anymore because I hate being in public more than anything, and pretending to be happy and present almost feels like I'm being overly fake. I'm tired. I'm exhausted with life, and my life in particular. I'm trying to take things one day at a time, but I don't know how much time I have. Holding on, holding on.",

Things were fine until I messed it all up again because that's all I ever do with friendships and deep personal relationships, I inevitably fuck things up and drive people away.

Entitled kid who wanted to cut off the edges on bread since he couldn't eat those. I guess leaving him the majority of the junk food for 9 years because he ate nothing else contributed to this entitledness.  \nSo I don't have many people to talk to since my brother is a judgemental narcissist.",

No friends, no memorable experiences, no long term happy relationship, no career to speak of it. I've hardly done anything with my 20's. I can't believe it. I hate the phrase \"you're so young, you still have time\". Yeah, I used to think that, and now I'm still in the same position as when all those people used to say that to me. Now I'm not so young anymore. Thinking that I was 'still young' was a mistake. It just causes you to slack and not try as hard to change circumstances because \"well, i have time, i'll do it tomorrow, next week, next month\". No, you don't have time. Time is the most expensive thing and you never get it back. All the experiences I dreamed of having when I was younger, that I was gonna become a beacon of my community and change lives... lol even just simple things like wanting to walk around the mall with a friend or watch a movie with someone, all my dreams are dead and buried. High school me would've been so disappointed. I would've killed myself back then if I knew I'd be where I am now.\nAnyway, trying to get into a new jobfield. I'm upset and annoyed that I've been waiting since August to work with this company, but I still have 2 interviews to do and then 3 weeks of training, only if I pass the interviews (and now I have to spend money on interview clothes). I won't be able to start working until December, maybe January. I just thought the process would be quicker but now it's gonna take so long. I need money now. This whole process is slowing me down and I'm extremely antsy, haven't been employed since July 2022 I'm so bored just being in the house all day, nothing excites me and I can't afford to do anything. It is so stressful being a human. I wish I didn't have to do any of this stuff. I don't even know what I'm doing it for either. I'd be getting a job just to help me continue to survive... but I don't like living. I don't want to make money to keep living longer. I guess the solution would be to starve... I hate this world so much, I hope for more climate disasters to come and hopefully Earth will the finish the process of exterminating us wretched humans who don't appreciate mother Earth, we just take from her, hoard, and make things worse for our fellow human.",

 "text": "I got into an argument with my 23 year old brother. He's been really selfish lately since when I ask him to talk or drop me off somewhere or anything really small he's always making excuses for why he can't do it. He'll say he'd rather not, or he's not good at talking to people, or my room is too messy and so is his if I ask for someone to talk to. Barely see him despite living next door to him. I'm much older and watched over him when he was younger all the time, giving him his bottle, even occasionally helping change diapers.  \nRecently I asked if I could use his curry to make some curry (with vegetables I bought). He said no, since he'd have to buy more. I thought of this as a last straw. He's always critical of whatever I do. But fuck there's empty toilet rolls on the ground in the bathroom and have been for months even before I arrived. He's not some paragon of a person himself, can't even bring it outside the bathroom to the trash.  \nI said fine I won't use his curry but not to eat the food I buy. He eats pb and j or whatever desserts I buy. Then he tried to say that I can't use the family's white car, that our parents own, because he uses it for work. He's been really possessive about the white car, the only one he's willing to drive cuz he's a spoiled little shit, for years. Wants to take it if he moves out but I know he probably won't move out. My parents don't bother him nearly enough.  \nWhen we go dragon boating he says it's ok to drive there after we'd decided to go by public transit but only if I drive. He's always trying to get out of doing any work. He just doesn't want to drive or pay for parking. He tries to get me to fill up the gas tank even being so spiteful as to come back with a near empty tank since he accuses me of always using the car. The thing is, and I argue this, I mostly only use it for local trips 2 miles away, not hour long commutes to work.  \nBut whatever it's only $40 I go fill up the tank. He wants me to fill up the white car half the time. The car that was supposed to go to me. But he's the one who uses it like 70% of the miles, my mom using 20%, and me another like 10%. How is this fair?  \nHe says I can't eat anything he makes anymore. And then threatens me with an \"are you sure you want to go down this route?\" Honestly I'm not sure if this is even worth reconciling. He's my brother, we don't choose our brothers. And I don't even know how we turned out so different. Genes probably. I can never get away from him being my brother but I sure can limit how much I talk to him.  \nHe's 23. All these years of me giving him the good room, him giving me the shitty chair he broke, always leaving more desserts and junk food for him when we were younger because I know he liked them, taking him to the park, giving him only compliments and trying to help him, getting into games to try to play them with him, teaching him science, playing with him daily, letting him use my laptop from games when I got back from work during internships. Sharing it when we were younger and giving him more time. And now I find out he's just a prick who doesn't care about any of it.  \nWhat do I do? If it were a friend I'd just cut the toxicity out of my life. Perhaps I let him get away with too much. Perhaps my mom let him become transactional when he was younger and that somehow developed into his narcissistic personality.",

She\u2019s literally always happy and never complains about anything and never seems anxious or depressed. She has so many friends and attracts a ton of people. She has a great body too and no issues with food. Also has a lot of nice clothing, jewelry, shoes, and more. \nMeanwhile I am constantly in this fight or flight mode with me biting the skin off my lips until they bleed or chewing my nails off. I never feel \u201cclean\u201d like I always have a grime on me even though I shower and wash my hands constantly. I feel as if my body looks strange. I\u2019ve been dealing with an eating disorder for the past year and a half. I feel so distraught and cynical about the world. I don\u2019t have a lot of friends and am just a very negative person.

However it still messes with my mentality and always wonder why her and not me.\nI actually don\u2019t want her specifics, like kids, I just wish I was happy like she was. And she was always prettier than me, so the guys in school always chased after her. I was the one in their boy talks about her.

If there was trauma during that time, then the amount of chemicals being released now in adulthood, is not balanced. So one half of the battle is addressing the thoughts and reactions we have that we can control (therapy helps here) and the other is to balance the chemicals in our brains that we cannot control (meds help here). If you can do this is conjunction with a healthy live style (exercise, hydration and good sleep) then in a relatively short period of time (a few months) you will start feeling better. More ambition, more excitement for the things you enjoy and better energy which will attract people to be around you. Not to mention you will enjoy being around yourself more, so the loneliness isn\u2019t always so strong",

It's also a sad reality that some people just don\u2019t deal with as much shit as some others. All the advice I can give you is you have to keep building on your mindset. Find little things every day where you're grateful for something about yourself or even someone else in your life. It is definitely a struggle, but I have grown to love myself more through challenging circumstances. There were abusive a-holes in my life wanting me to feel awful, so as I'm a rebel, lol, I started to give them the finger and tell myself I actually fucking really like myself. Not in a hostile way either, I just don't engage with people who make me feel like there's something inherently unlovable about me.

I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m living a life worth living I guess or I\u2019m just basically surviving. I\u2019m distant from family and friends and often think about not being here anymore because I\u2019m overwhelmed constantly from being broke, lonely and hating where I\u2019m at in life. I\u2019ve ofcourse been diagnosed with major clinical depression but I\u2019m not currently taking anything for it since I just switched jobs from a call center which wrecked my mental health (literally had to go on leave for two months due to anxiety) back to retail which is much better but doesn\u2019t pay much at all especially with the cost of living. I\u2019m a loner, super friendly at work and make friends that want to hang out but I always give excuses or just don\u2019t want to be around anyone. I feel so shitty about never seeing my mom or calling my grandparents, I don\u2019t ask for help when I need it from them either (probably some resentment or need to be independent after going through some hard times with them as a teen coming out as gay) Recently I\u2019ve really been nonchalant towards trying to keep up with bills and responsibilities since I feel like I\u2019ll always be in this situation. I just feel like I don\u2019t care about anything anymore, art doesn\u2019t bring my joy anymore which also kills me inside. I smoke weed daily and started drinking more over the last year which is scary for me because I\u2019ve never been much of a drinker before. I just want to change so bad but I don\u2019t know where to start, feels like fog brain tbh where I just get ts stressed and shut down mentally when trying to tackle anything in my life. \nI don\u2019t want to give up on myself and slowly building self love and want to believe I deserve to be here but a lot of times I just feel negative and lost so if anyone has any advice or maybe a similar experience to this mess of a post I\u2019d appreciate it. Hope all of you struggling too find peace.",

When I'm feeling better, It somehow ironically feels awful not being depressed and wanting the void back, but when all the shit comes crashing down on me again, all I want is it going away. I don't understand why it feels safe in a sense being depressed. Does anyone else have similar experiences?",

There\u2019s nothing and I mean nothing good about having autism. You have sensory issues, anxiety, either low or high emotions, and you see almost everything way differently than other people do which sucks. Not only that but people that claim that they understand those with autism are full of shit. Most people don\u2019t care about those that are autistic and majority would rather make fun of autistic people than befriend them. The world is just incredibly boring and lame to me, and human beings are annoying. Not only that but people constantly shut you down for almost anything, and you can\u2019t really relate to anyone. I just live in my own world, and I always daydream that I\u2019m in a different reality, because the reality that I\u2019m in sucks. It actually helps me calm down because I have anger issues and I use to self-harm a lot(scratches, and hard head bangs, never got a concussion in my life but I do have a permanent scar from the back of my head). I realized that as I got older, I got more anxious and angrier, and majority of the time I have intense intrusive thoughts of wanting to hurt people \nIt annoys me when I see posts of people saying that autism is great, personally I rather be neurotypical because with autism your mind is having constant conflict with yourself, you perceive things differently than others which isn\u2019t good because Neurotypicals view you as either sociopathic or a troll. They\u2019re times where they mostly annoy me and I feel apathetic towards them. I\u2019ve had way more people treat me like shit throughout my entire life than actually befriend me which probably explains why I don\u2019t like anyone, and why I don\u2019t have any friends. The world is so different and so backwards, that most stuff that happens in the world just doesn\u2019t make sense to me at all. I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, and I doubt that I ever will since I\u2019m autistic, this isn\u2019t me complaining this is just the harsh truth of reality that I\u2019ve come in terms to tbh. I wouldn\u2019t mind being deceased before I reach 25(hopefully from a freak accident or murder).",

But thank fuck I keep it in usually (except for the lashing out, sadly) and never break anything or physically harm anyone.\nI too get angry if someone wants me to do something, asks me a simple question, talks to me or tries to keep up a conversation, or even if I have to clean something/pick it up off the damn ground. And it's almost always that same kind of deafening anger that makes me want to tear my skin off as though that would free me from being locked inside my body.

Whether it be in school or just out in about in life or at work or wherever. I feel like I'm punished either way. The good times are fleeting.\nMe and my girlfriend broke up last week and I'm at the lowest I've ever been. I've been going 2 two 3 days at a time without sleeping or eating and when I do it's because I force myself to. I haven't felt tired or hungry. I'm tired of being able to relate to all the negative shit on my social medias. I find happiness in other people and I finally came to the realization what I need in my life is someone who I can always spend time with, who I can share space with and see any time, only to remember her and the pain in my heart and the fact that she was everything I ever wanted and now I'll never get to hold her in my arms again. We're still good friends but it's just not the same.\nI'm tired of being surrounded by friends and still being lonely. I don't know why. I've went to therapy. I've went to a psychiatrist. She prescribed me mood stabilizers and I just felt like I was in a backseat of my own brain. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like being awake nor do I feel like going to sleep. I don't even feel like breathing. I'm not suicidal or trying to take my own life but I'm st the point where I don't care whether or not I wake up the next time I sleep.",

I've been what I call white knuckling it for a while now, just pushing and pushing myself. Although it gets me through my days, the underlying depression is still there. Does that make any sense? I can be productive and still feel very depressed underneath it all. I've been hesitant to go back to therapy because I'm so tired of feeling like I have to be dependent on a therapist all of the time, and it's a financial drain. I tell myself that I'm 52 years old, and I need to learn how to stand on my own two feet instead of always having to rely on a therapist to keep me mentally healthy.\nSo here's what I'm trying for a week. I'm giving up my daily glass of red wine after work. And that's not just for a week. That's until this depression is gone.  It's time to get serious! I also use a lot of escapism like watching TV and being on screens. I'm going to limit that. I also do not get enough sleep, so I have created a bedtime of 9:30 pm regardless of what I'm doing. I'm incorporating daily walks with my dogs and daily exercise of one form or another, be it just taking a short walk or going to a group fitness class. Also being sure to socialize and reach out to friends and family.\nI'm giving this a test drive for a week to see how it goes. If, after one week, I still feel depressed, I'm going to go back to therapy. I have to do something because I don't want to keep living life feeling this way.",

After 10 years in the industry was burned out and over it. \nNow I do non meaningful, short term, contract work. When I have energy I spend time on my art as a creative outlet. I\u2019d love to make money from painting or writing but it\u2019s quite hard, especially in the beginning. My advice would be to make sure you\u2019re able to pay your bills/rent with a steady job, and make time for your art. Practice daily if possible. Just keep on creating, push yourself to do more. See exhibitions, follow and engage with artists and their work online or in person; hopefully you\u2019ll find inspiration and one day break on through.",

 "text": "Don\u2019t want to face another new day, ever. Hi everyone,\nThis is my first post in here, so I want to apologise for format and grammar errors, as English is not my first language. And a warning for a potential long post.\nSo, I am at a very dark spot in my life. I am a 24 year old male from Portugal. It all started when I was 17 years old. At that time of my life I was on the top of the World. I was doing great at school, part of the most popular group at school, excelent grades, lots of friends. I was also playing football, as it was my dream to be a professional football player. I was in the Starting team and full of real hopes of becoming pro. I was also in a relationship (my first serious relationship) that started when i was 16.\nSo, it all started coming downhill when I tore my ACL in a game close to my 17th birthday. It was a very hard operation and a very painful recovery, that i was very lucky to have my girlfriend supporting closely and daily. I never got rid of pain in my knee and could not return to football. So basically I had to give up and let go my major passion in life. But hey still have my academic life, friends and girlfriend who i loved with all my heart and thought we would be forever together.\nAbout 1 year after my injury I started having anxiety attacks and was left with an intense pain in my chest 24/7, whom only my girlfriend was able to calm down.\nI graduated High School and as I was starting college my girlfriend of (at this time) 2,5 years cheated on my and even blamed me for it.\nMy first year of college was extremely s\u00e9rio and I was thinking of droping out.\nSo, at this time (around 19 years old) I:\n. Lost my passion and was \u201crobbed\u201d of my dream.\n. Lost my girlfriend who was my biggest support (due to her cheating).\n. Lost my academic success.\n. Had multiple situations and problems with friends and family.\nIn a span of 2 years I lost almost everything.\nAll of this Just to elaborate briefly the path that took me to my present state.\nSo, I got my college degree last year. Started working this year (a boring 9-6, with extremely toxic co-workers).\nAs of today, I feel traped, I hate my life, hate my job, I dont feel happiness, I am Always tired and in pain, I pushed off all of my friends, I have 0 hope of being Happy ever again, I wake up everyday angry with the fact that I didnt died in my sleep, and I am 24/7 thinking and wishing that something kills me.\nI am very tired and growing concerned that one day I will not have \u201cone more day\u201d in me and take it upon myself to end my life. \nAnyone with some advice or able to share a little glimpse of hope?\nOnce again, sorry for format, long and language.",

Usually, I sleep with my phone on do not disturb, on a table near my bed, and have a light, pretty song as my alarm. Recently, I went through a very bad depressive slump and was oversleeping to a new level. (I have been diagnosed with MDD and take Sertraline). This time, I couldn't get out of bed for days and slept most of a week away. For the first time in my life, I also slept through alarms. I'm a college student and attendance matters in all my courses this year. I've never ever not woken up to an alarm before, and it's now happened twice, causing me to miss classes, and today I was late to give my own midterm presentation, which was embarrassing and also damaging to my grade. I'm on the end of this depressive cycle, I'm able to go to classes again and can manage to get myself to do things while I'm out, but I'm wondering if the sleeping through alarms is linked to depression somehow? Could it be making me a heavier sleeper, as in my body is physically resisting waking up?",

I wasn't nearly as depressed back then, but still somehow missed some of them to where I now set 3 alarms usually. Also if you got any smart watch, they seem to help me wake up by the first alarm as well as it buzzes your wrist. You just sound possibly too tired or overworked which can lead to your body's first result to just turn off the alarm asap to get more rest.",

But then things started to get toxic, i wasn't allowed to be friendly with anyone and my freedom was gone. Even though it has been like that, i still listened to him and became very submissive because i value him and i believed all his plans for us.

The main catalyst for the change was moving far upcountry (uk) for family reasons during that entire year due to decisions from my mother just getting with a (unknown at the time) abusive stepfather and a myriad of reckless financial decisions we ended up homeless for about 9 months compared to what had been a stable life before the move. During this time I spoke to no one my own age, barely spoke to my mother and stepfather and I feel this is the time developed social anxiety but moving on the next year I was finally able to get into school (year 9) and the one thing going for me is personally even up until now school has been a nonfactor as it\u2019s easy, not the top of the top but 7s mostly all round without so much as studying (for Americans we have a numbering system 4-9 and 7 is like an a, 8 is an a* and 9 an a**) with the grades I got I could do anything I want really, at this point my social anxiety and the effects of the stepfather were kicking in, he was a ridiculous Chainsmoker soon after he arrived everything I owned smelled of smoke only heightening my anxiety making it so I\u2019d have as little interaction as possible, a girl tried hugging me before a winter break and all I could think of was when will it be over what if it smells. Then the pandemic hit and that was nice as I didn\u2019t even attend the \u201cmandatory \u201c e lessons put on by the school and faced no repercussions for them but during this time the sense of isolation and weird emptiness crept in, I should mention this step dad also took all devices from me at all times so I was limited to starting out the window for stimulation. By the time quarantine ended we went back to school for 6 months and that went and passed still each day was agonizing as I always felt people were laughing or judging me even if they had never seen my before, I\u2019d interact with people around and friends as much as I\u2019d need to in order to appear normal but as soon as summer break hit I didn\u2019t interseat with anyone until I knew one of my friends was going to the same college I was. It was practically school except I could get away from interacting with anyone even more but now that\u2019s said and done and it\u2019s been since march I think that I\u2019ve spoken to anyone I know, only people I speak to are my mother and whatever persons on the till at the shop \nAnd lately I\u2019ve had this growing sense of disconnection, more than I ever have but I can\u2019t speak to anyone because what if they\u2019ll judge me and how will I get the words out if I\u2019m sweating buckets practically hyperventilating in front of them due to anxiety, yesterday I tried to off myself by taking every pill my mum has (she\u2019s ill for a lot of things not fatal tho) but I took 15 mins swallowing them and went to sleep but woke up sweating and with that urge you get before you throw up and then did like 4 times .now I\u2019m just in a lot of pain and feel physically weak , I still feel empty but don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll try again because i I\u2019m a coward and afraid of the pain \nSorry that was long",

I was slightly depressed but had a lot of anxiety\nAnd now im in 6th and i really thought i was getting better but so far this school year really sucks rn.  My teacher called on me to read, i wouldnt mind often but it always gave me a little bit anxiety.  Then all of a sudden her tone changed slightly to an angry tone and i started crying.  shes sorry but idrk if i forgive her lol\nTHEN another incident happened where my friend almost told my friends a secret i told her ,, (it was personal, i didnt want her to share it) i skipped the last period bcz of that and stayed crying\nand now all my friends started ignoring me.  I still have my best friend, but where not in the same classes.  I switched schedules bcz of my friends ignoring me and i didnt wanna deal with that..\nrn im staying up because i dont want tomorrow to sooner,,i hate this loop\nidk what to do at this point i wanna drop out of school but i cant </3 everyday i just wanna sleep not do anything at all,, just sleep",

 "text": "Does depression feel like PEM in chronic fatigue syndrome? I've had severe fatigue on top of my depression and mental health issues ever since I got sick with a strong flu in 2019. I get a hangover everytime I do something out of my energy envelope, like meeting friends, going places. It sometimes skips a day or two if it's really bad, like I could overdo it in friday and have a crash on sunday. I get muscle pains, extreme fatigue, feel feverish and poisoned and sometimes a bit like I'm going to get a flu that never comes. It has just gotten worse and more severe over time as I have just pushed through it as you do with mental health issues. I'm almost bedbound for a week after travel, I met with a friend last time 2 months ago and was hungover and in bed for 3 days. I have lost my ability to recover from things somehow, I severely overdid it in the summer last year and still haven't returned to how I was before that. My doctor told me it's clinical depression and severe burnout. I had burnout and depression before this but it felt different and not like this. I feel so much motivation to do things and it makes me depressed and kills me inside that I can't do those things and am glued to bed these days. I don't get more energy even when my mood is better, in a way it's even more dangerous because I'm more likely to overdo it and have a crash while in a good mood.\nHave you gotten this kind of symptoms during depression or a burnout? Am I just experiencing health anxiety?",

As far as convos you need to find out why do you feel like you need to talk so much. Like do you live alone and don't talk to anyone all day so when you do get a chance to talk you go above and beyond?     Start to listen to people. People might not mind the conversation if it's actually a conversation. If you are the only one talking it's not a conversation. So learn to listen. Listen for cues that that person doesn't want to talk anymore.  Things like \"ok talk to you later\" , \"welp I better get going\" or if they sigh or take a deep breath like they are getting annoyed. People taking steps away from you is a good sign.  If you like talking find groups online you can talk to. Find groups that have similar hobbies.",

I always thought about these days when I was 16 . \nI miss when I got out of high school . I didn't work for like 4 years . Those where the best stress free times of my life . All I did was smoke weed play the PS3 until 5 or 8 am and wake up at 2 pm with not a care in the world . Playing battlefield 3 and modern warfare 3 and GTA 4 all night . \nI feel like I'm still that teenager. But the mirror tells me otherwise . I feel like an imposter being an adult . I have exhausted smoking weed and playing video games . I spent many years wasted doing that shit . I was always a handsome dude and would get attention from girls everywhere I went but I never developed social skills so I never got a girlfriend. My biggest regret in life is that I spent my good years leaning on my looks rather then trying to develop a personality. Now that my looks are slowly fading away Im going through a sort of crisis of who I am exactly.  I'm learning that even tho you still feel young you can't be seen feeling young because it's weird .

This might be my first time posting here on r/depression since I normally just vent to my friends, but I just can't handle it anymore after today and need to get it off my chest to lots of people..\n\u200b\nFirst, starting with whenever I feel worthless.. I've felt that way for a long time in my life, lots of years by now... It's the type of depression that's triggered by seeing someone better than me at anything really or other times, when someone gets to go somewhere I wish I could go to (MLP conventions, etc) or has something I'd die to have (a lifesize Rainbow Dash plush, etc)... I feel like my mind thinks different than most people since my mind doesn't believe that everyone in the world is equal, but instead that there are people who can be bad at stuff...\nWhenever I get in those depressive moods... It feels so daunting and crippling that I just wonder if one of those kinds of people who are better than me would replace me, none of my friends or my mom would remember me and the person replacing me would do a better job and not make any of the mistakes I've made with friends in the past that cost me my older friends... Eventually though after lots of minutes of sulking, I just move on with my day and find a game to play on my laptop or Steam Deck since at that point, I realize I'd just be wasting more time.\n\u200b\nAs for my art.. Since I am a Brony (one of the millions of adult male fans of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic), I draw lots of art for the fandom and have ever since I've joined the fandom (late sadly..) in early 2020. We mainly post on an image sharing site called Derpibooru. But unfortunately on there... I've always been given lots of downvotes on my drawings which makes my depression and beliefs from my depression even worse while you have to watch practically every other artist not get downvotes and also get lots of upvotes... Here is a link to my gallery on Derpibooru if any of you are curious.\n\u200b\nAnyways, I think I'll end the post here. I talked about almost all my depression and don't really know what else to add to the post..",

I am thinking of truly going for weight loss and to be healthier. My question is: through what action do SSRIs make people gain weight? Is it that your metabolism is much slower? Is it that you crave food more often? I really need help so any advice at all regard weight loss would be greatly appreciate \ud83e\udd7a",

 "text": "I think I'm depressed. I have a lot yet I share a lot with what I read here. How to and how you cope? Hello friends,\nI am 36, soon 37\nI have a stable job as a programmer and project manager, a car, a family, a house, loved ones and 2 or 3 selected friends because I hate people.  \nYet I can't bear life. There are too much chores and duties.\nI want to take some pieces from other posts and add up my own stuff to get a picture of who feels the same. I need to know If everyone feels like this.  \nYou have to take care of your body. Brush your teeth, shave, shower, get regular haircuts. Eat varied, healthy meals. Exercise regularly. You need a varied and fashionable wardrobe for social occasions.\nYou need money to support yourself and your lifestyle. You have to work or study for years to advance in anything that's not a dead end career. You have to deal with your boss, with your coworkers, with your clients. You have to deal with a thousand other people in a cutthroat environment who all want the same job or that promotion. You have to devote at least 40 hours a week to this, sometimes more.  \nYou need to develop your identity and your personality. Find what interests you and pursue it. Have hobbies, read books, be an interesting person. You have to maintain a social life on top of all this. You have your family, your friends, your significant other. Birthdays, anniversaries, Thanksgivings, Christmases. Mandatory social obligations. Gifts. Money. Endless conversation. Most of it is fake. There are so many unspoken rules and customs involved in social interaction and you're not allowed to show weakness. It's a constant, tiring charade and everybody knows it's an act but it goes on and on and on.\nLiterally this month i got the highest salary of my life (which isn't bad for the place were I live) an it quickly got killed in expenses of various kind. I was so happy to have gotten higher than ever and life slapped me and took my wallet out of my pocked and burned it. Broken household appliance, car taxes, rent, kid going to school, gas/light/water bills and I could keep going.\nThis is a fucking rat race. It's too much responsibility, too much chaos.  \nI tried.\nI keep challenging myself.\n At the age of 25 I tried again to not be a miserable failure and so I applied to University of computer science.\nTo prepare for that, I challenged myself once again and said: \"Am i fucking stupid to not being able to have any meaningful social circle or is that I don't even put a fkn effort in it?\"\nANd so 2 months prior beginning of university I quit computer, videogames, every bad habit.\nI started watching tv, reading, hanging out at every possible occasion and if it wasn't possible I actively pushed others to go out.  \nIt turned out well. I don't want to bother you with details, but I was quite popular also with girls even if I am a musclefat bear (i do lot of weightlifting up to this day, it's the only thing I've been constant in my life) so I don't have the typical cute boy appeal.  \nIt was all fake. I didn't study much, there was too effort involved and 2 years in, I found a 4 years contract full time job and I fully abandoned studyng, In the time of 1 month 95% of that people disappeared and just a few friends remained, which by the way now have their life and occasionally reunite ot go out but mainly we don't care each other.\n\u200b\nI ELABORATED  \nNot that I didn't expect any better, but I elaborated a lot on that and realized that most people needs someone to listen them, and I was that person. I was cool, i was listening, I was making whole worlds of conversation on their and my hints in conversation (hint = they say something, you hook on it and build up more and more conversation), my mind was sharp because I killed the dopamine addiction and I could come up with every kind of joke.  \nBut it all ended. As soon as you're not the sharp guy, who listens and it's funny all the time, who can provide benefits (there was mutual helping with computers, helping with connections in life, listening)  everyone quickly disappears, showing that you're only a mean to a purpose. They need you because of what you can provide and don't give a fuck if you get a brain cancer or your mother dies, if you're good or not.  \nIt's a damn rollercoaster on which you have to actively put effort to always stay on top and be interesting for others.\nIt was too much effort to always keep that high, I couldn't handle it anymore and I let it go.\nFUck no, now I'm mostly alone, 2 or 3 friend to go out or play videogames online once in a while and that's it. I have my hobbies, I study I go gym and take all the time I can for myself.  \nI ELABORATED AGAIN\nI try to find the positive. I like my hobbies, they keep my mind alive and give me a purpose, that's why I spend so much time on them. It's a way to flee away from reality and feel a better person afterward.  \nBut you have to return to planet earth.  \nGym training ends and you get back to the chores.\nVideogaming takes much hours and you get nothing out of it and feel guilty afterwardm and you still got to do chores afterward.\nStudying for my work/passion which are computer, programming, artificial intelligence and so on: It's the only excuse I can use to get alone and do something and people not disturb me because they think I'm doing something important. But it ends and there are the chores, the taxes, the problems waiting at the end of the flight.  \nIt's constantly about finding a way to not think about problems.  \nI ELABORATED AGAIN  \n1.Some people is born ready: They're clever and handsome and get into stuff quickly and soon they realize where to aim in life and can navigate through all the problems  \n2.Some other people is not born as much clever, but they are either handsome or have a mindset for living this kind of life.\nFor these people most of the stuff I complain just clicks in place in their life plan.  \nThey have the some troubles that I see, but they see it as part of their life plan, smash the problems and get to the next point. They don't have problems to socialize, the whole fake conversation and fake friends thing works well because they're the same kind of person of these fake friends.  \n3.There is me. A lifetime second place.  \nEverything of what's necessary in life at some point can be achieved, but there will be always someone better than you. Someone is always smarted and do things better than you. Never socialized well.  \nSocial anxiety, misanthropy and other negative stuff gorws because you can never do well enough.  \nI ended up accepting that i'm so so and that life will always be like this\n\nThere are lower ranks but I won't go into it because I cannot really experience what it's like and would be stupid talking for them.\n\nI don't know, I only know I think about suicide in a non serious way daily.\nThe only thing that keeps me to move this thought to something more concrete it's that my parents are alive and I can't give them this unbearable pain.\nBut as soon as they're gone, my heart will be finally torn apart completely and maybe I will find the willpower to bring something to completion in my life.",

 "text": "Realizations as I (M) Approach 30 This weekend, I (M29) had a panic attack while driving. I was able to pull into a parking lot where I threw up and sweat buckets with my head in my hands. Not sure if someone called the cops or if they just happened to see me, but the cops showed up and made it a big scene. To their credit, though, since I was in control enough to articulate that I didn\u2019t need help from them, they eventually left me alone.\nI talked to my mom about it and she asked what it was that got me so upset, and it feels almost impossible to explain. These last few years have been extremely difficult and I think now, as I approach 30, it\u2019s really sinking in that I\u2019m just not going to have a very nice life. \nNothing gives me sustained joy and everything seems to send me spiraling. Because I feel so unstable, I\u2019ve never been able to build a real life for myself. Despite having a college degree, I work a menial dead end office job that I\u2019ve been in for 5 years simply because they tolerate my mental health issues and I know I would crumble if given any real responsibilities.  \nBetween medical costs associated with my depression, my crappy salary, and my hometown becoming a gentrified hellhole, I\u2019m a missed paycheck or two away from being completely broke. \nI am terrified of emotional intimacy and so none of my relationships last. I\u2019m very confident I will never marry. I can barely take care of myself let alone another person, so it would be unethical for me to have children. I have a few friends, but I rarely have the energy to spend much time with them. \nI am painfully lonely, bored, and my depression is worsening as I come to accept that this is probably what my whole life is going to be like. I feel physical pain every morning I wake up, throughout the day, and in the evening. I want to stop existing so badly, but I don\u2019t want to subject my family members to living in the shadow of my suicide and so I think if I ever choose that route, it would be after my parents pass away.\nHaving been severely depressed since I was a child, I find that our society (America) copes well with people who experience situational depression, but really has no solution for people who experience severe lifelong depression other than to subject us to lives or poverty and social ostracism, force us to become burdens to our families, or let us die.",

Its kinda struck me recently that my life is so insignificant compared to acomplished musicians, atheltes, actors, etc.. my age (22) and i get this deep envy that im not living life to the fullest.\nTouring the world and playing music, acting in big films, the rest goes on. My life just feels so mundane in comparison and I'm not sure how to really reconcile with being normal. \nObviously they did have to work hard to get to where they are at, but at my age it feels a bit late to really pursue things like those anymore and im locked into a STEM career for the rest of my life which doesn't really appeal to me.\nHow do i feel better about myself and the life that I have for myself going forward? How do i find happiness despite knowing I may not be able to be an acclaimed musician, actor, athlete, or someone doing something really cool in life?",

If you have a degree and are in a STEM field, you are quite literally doing better than the majority of the world. Your life is far from mundane, it\u2019s a minority. But you\u2019re upset\u2026 because\u2026 you\u2019re not a rockstar or famous actor? I think you should reflect on what you have and spend time with those that don\u2019t. \nPick up a job at a factory with a temp agency - preferably one with low pay and high turnover. Do it for a few days and I PROMISE you will meet people who have truly had shitty lives. Your life isn\u2019t normal, and I\u2019m sorry that your life experiences have sheltered you from seeing what life is like for the true, average human being in the modern world. So many people would trade places with you simply to put food on the table and have extra money to let their kid go on that field trip - don\u2019t insult those folks by being unappreciative of what you have.\nYou\u2019ve found your role in society, now you just need to find out what makes it worth it. If you can learn to appreciate what you have, it will help you take more pride and joy within your societal role. As always, seek medical help if you\u2019re contemplating hurting yourself or others.",

But for the past month she's been expressing her depression and feelings of hopelessness. The reason is because she married the wrong person. She married someone who was an alcoholic, someone who degrades her family every time he's drunk, and doesn't give a shit about her well being at all. They have a child together and she is happy with her child, but she can't help but feel sad that she made a mistake and that she wasted time with the wrong person. Our family has given her so much good advice, but she still feels depressed and I honestly don't know what I can do to get her to snap out of it. My heart hurts because I can't see or feel what she's going through and she can't put it into words to even being to possibly explain what's going on in her mind. I'm emotional just typing this all out.\n  So my question to you lovely people of reddit is, what can I do to help my sister through this battle? I'll be her backbone, shoulder to cry on, and ear to listen whenever she needs me, but I can't help but feel like there's something more that can be done.

 "text": "Psychotherapy and other forms of \"help\" feel like coping bullshit We eat, sleep, work, and perform chores, yet none of these activities bring happiness, at least not to me.\nI find myself incessantly chasing something, yet I remain unaware of what I am chasing.\nWhen I express that life feels miserable, the common suggestion is therapy. Yet, the idea of paying someone to gaslight me, to question my judgments, is unappealing. They might suggest that my situation isn't as dire as I perceive, reminding me that I still have the capacity to work and contribute. They might say, \"You are providing value to your boss and to your customers.\" But I often think, \"What the hell?\" I couldn't care less about them. Everyday, I have to face these people, feign a pleasant expression, and act courteously, even when they behave like jerks.\nHaving read about Stoicism, I came across the notion that others act out of ignorance, and that reacting negatively would only display my own ignorance. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) would advise me to reframe my thoughts and accept the situation. However, I refuse to accept this. I crave a solution, not a slow grind through life that ultimately culminates in a debilitating disease. Why should I wait for such a fate? This tedious routine fails to spark any excitement; it's just an endless grind interspersed with fleeting moments of joy.\nI reject the ideas of embracing virtues, taking mind-numbing pills, or reframing and accepting my circumstances.\nI am reminded of Clayton Arteus, a man who planned a bike journey from North America to South America. Tragically, an accident in Mexico left him a paraplegic. Despite his active and adventurous life prior to the accident, his new reality shattered his aspirations. He was a devoted bodybuilder, a seeker of life-enriching experiences, much like what I yearn for. He aimed to narrow the gap between Nietzsche's concept of the overman and himself. However, post-accident, he realized his goals were now unattainable. While others might insist that life still held value, he believed otherwise. His determination to end his life on his own terms rather than endure a restricted existence resonates with me. I share his sentiment; the thought of living a life devoid of the activities I love, reliant on others for basic needs, is unbearable.",
