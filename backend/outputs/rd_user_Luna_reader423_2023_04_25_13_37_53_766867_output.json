Your mom's really toxic tho, I don't know anything of your grandma, but if she's nice, maybe you can talk to her and she can talk to your mom. Also you should decide who you're friends with and it's really not her place to say you can't be friends with someone who helps you get through more than her. If you want to talk, I'm here (13 F btw)",

I know I'm really fk annoying for saying u should \"try\", because sometimes you just can't. But if your mom knows about this, or maybe a teacher, they can help you with school rules. Maybe you can come in a little later and go home earlier if people know how sick you are.",
