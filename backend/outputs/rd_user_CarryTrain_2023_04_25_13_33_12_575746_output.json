Like he seems to have done with Serelis as a HC. \nI\u2019d say they also gotta keep Lee. He has been a defensive menace in the Mon-Oly play off series from last season. He can make some buckets with some open threes and his floaters. But definitely not a starting 5 PG. Given that Pana is rumoured to sign Vildoza, Facu or both he is an important asset.\nBig papa is gonna leave Ig so no point talking about the guy. \nOf course they gotta utilise the young talented players they got parked on the bench. Especially Mantzoukas. \nThe rest of the roster is replaceable imo.",

Every woman that was an acquitance, a friend, a coworker was there to get me. I didn\u2019t make friends with women cause I didn\u2019t want to set her off. I didn\u2019t make comments about anyone cause she\u2019d be set off. \nOn the night of our break up, after she broke up with me cause she can\u2019t trust me anymore, we got so drunk. I put her in my bed until she is sober so she can go her way in the morning. She said something to me that set me off, and before I left my house to go and sleep in my office, I told her \u201cIt\u2019s my fault I wasted four years of my life with you. Go back to your shitty cocaine addiction, and you can just OD and drop dead for all I care.\u201d \nI still regret those words, and I have apologised for these words over and over again.

 "text": "Girl wants me to take her virginity I need advice Look man. I took some girl\u2019s virginity twice so far. First was my first time as well so technically it doesn\u2019t count. But the second was when I had experience and I dated that girl for a year.\nFirst times are hard for them. If you wanna do it you must be caring and you must care for her. I\u2019d ask often if everything is okay or if she is hurting by something I do. Start small and for the love of god don\u2019t go jackhammering\u2026 When a girl loses her virginity with you she must be comfortable. You cannot just hook up with her. The most decent thing you can do is turn that experience into something she\u2019ll remember fondly later.\nThat being said, if you\u2019re only planning to hook up with her, don\u2019t do it. I doubt you can think of her comfort in that degree when you have no emotional attachment to her\u2026",

 "text": "Why don't women listen to men about men's own psychology/thought patterns? This is very valid btw. I will give you an example from my personal life. \nI know this person. They had anxiety issues and panic attacks related to the workplace and some abusive relationships they had. Every time something triggered them I would take them to dinner/lunch so they can vent to me and not feel alone. I made myself available for any venting, advices and so on. Mind you I\u2019ve been dealing with depression ever since I was a kid. And I had no one to help me. So my idea was when I\u2019d encounter a person who was in a similar boat and they\u2019re willing to accept my help, well, id help! And so I did! \nDon\u2019t take this the wrong way. I don\u2019t help expecting to be helped. But it brushed me the wrong way when I had a depressive episode this person was seeing me sad and kept insisting to open up to them. And I did. After I did, they grew distant. Barely talking to me. \nWhat I want to say is people will be keen to help you. But they most likely won\u2019t. Your negative emotions are a deal breaker for every kind of personal relationship. You\u2019re always allowed to show good emotions. I learnt that the hard way from my mom who threatened to kick me out of the house for \u201cbeing always sad\u201d. From teenage friends, because I \u201cwas always a bummer being around\u201d. From girlfriends who\u2019d ask me to open up only to dump me months later. From friends in my adult life as I described above. In my anecdotal experience, men shouldn\u2019t show negative emotions. Only positive ones.",

It\u2019s not that I wanted to be on her good side, but seeing her smile as she would get an hour or two of extra rest would make me feel so happy. \nWhen I go out with my friend I always walk her home, even if that means I\u2019ll get home an hour later. It\u2019s a win win. She feels safe walking home with me and it also makes me feel good that I care for someone. \nMakes me feel good.",

It\u2019s easy but there is this part at the end where it\u2019s a little bit sped up. I probably bothered for 15mins or so since it was late but building up the speed is tricky for me. Always feels like there is a lag betweeen changing the picking on different strings. That\u2019s why I\u2019m using metronome. It is a bit clearer where I\u2019m going wrong with this.",

Every email I sent I either got no reply, we don\u2019t speak English (even though listed as English speaking) or we are overbooked and our waiting queues are full. My friend found a session the next day and I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t ask where, until 3 months later. She got a spot in a practice where they were claiming to be overbooked. I even have their reply on my email. 18 months later I\u2019m still haven\u2019t been contacted back and every effort I make to find a therapist ends up fruitless. 18 months later she is making healthy relationships, while I\u2019m sinking into depression. \nSince then I\u2019m ready to die on the hill that women\u2019a mental health is more important to society.",

I\u2019m really passionate about stuff but usually I don\u2019t (or can\u2019t?) show it. Also have this strong feeling that showing excitement will drive people away. Usually that\u2019s my observation since my teenage years.",

 "text": "If you feel the need to tell someone not to talk to their ex, that person was never for you in the first place. Last year I was dating a girl I was madly in love with! \nOne night, my ex girlfriend with whom we split up in good terms sent me to wish me happy bday and to share her newly published paper. My replies were and I quote \u201cThanks.\u201d And \u201cwell deserved!\u201d.\nThe next morning I told my girlfriend that X published a paper, wanting to casually mention that this text exchange happened so I wouldn\u2019t be hiding anything. She got so mad, requested to read the conversation and threatened to leave and disappear from my life if I don\u2019t. Long story short, she broke up with me 3 months later cause she \u201ccouldn\u2019t trust me\u201d due to this incident. My lesson from this was to 1. Never fully disclose stuff and 2. Never talk to an ex again. I still miss her",

While I don\u2019t expect someone to make as much as I make, I still expect my future life partner to have her own ambitions and work towards them, I still expect her to be self reliant at the first stages of our relationship. \nLong story short, I\u2019m not gonna carry someone throughout life just for the sake of having a life partner.",

And I wish I could downvote it a million times.\nWe have to be ourselves and we have to first solve major mental issues before we get out in the dating scene. Then go ahead and find a partner who YOU will deem worthy your time and mental energy. And if you dont, it is alright. Life has so many beautiful things to enjoy.

And they would give bs religious replies which didn\u2019t make any sense to me as I was openly an atheist. And it was a turning point for me. \nMy thoughts on homosexuality was the reason I got so close with my best friend who is gay. \nIm so glad I escaped this group\u2026",

She went to the funeral. Then her boss fucked her over and she filed to quit in the next three months, a lot of things break at her place and so many other things. Recently her best friend who was in Italy for a family matter had a serious injury and he has to get into surgery on his leg and now she has to take care of all his business in Germany for the next 2 months. I remember that she was saying that everything is going wrong. And she jokingly (not entirely sure) said that everything started going wrong since she started dating me again. Without of course blaming me or anything. At least not conciously. All that while my work is exploding.\n\u200b\n\nIt's good that you're meeting her. Be ambivalent. If she asks you about your progress, just under play. Give her time.. ask about her family/friends and she may open up with you.\n\nWill do that once again. I was planning to take her to a very good restaurant with her favorite cuisine, take her to an amusement park, keep her busy in general.\nBut man I am dieing inside. At one hand I am afraid that she will end it because she can't do it anymore and at the other hand I am afraid that you are right and she might be depressed. If I had to choose, I hope break-up is the thing. I want only the best for her. I love her so damn much.\nI don't know if I should text her to check up if she is ok. Especially, since she has not opened my last texts.",

I am also not planning on giving up the hard work I have put so far in my project only for one of his favorites to collect my efforts. So the PhD ends in this lab. To answer your question, no.

You do not produce results because your boss asks you to but because you want a lit paper under your name. You produce results to get your PhD not to make an asshole happy. I also never ask questions in public on lab meetings. I always go privately to people to discuss for their projects and ideas I may have. Trust me I joined in a cytoskeleton lab when in my cell biology classes I was struggling to understand the whole topic especially the biochem. I am sure you will nail it!",

I just\n got into the 2nd year and I have a phenotype, in an experimental setup I\n optimized myself and some other nice results. However, I feel so alone.\n My supervisor is a huge ass. When I first arrived he talked big game\nabout how his door is always open and how I should not think him as a\nboss and blah blah. However, I am not smart. I am not fast at thinking\non my feet. Not when I'm nervous and I'm always nervous around him cause\n he gets really mean really fast when I don't pick up what he's talking\nabout. And after a year I really start to feel like a useless second\ngear student at my lab. I'm really sad most of the time. I have no\nmentoring and very very very little supervision. All of the other not so\n senor students are in projects based on previous projects from previous\n lab members so they know what they're looking at. They all have some\nkind of a post doc over them.

 "text": "I got some of the looks, I got no game. Hey friend. Thanks for taking the time to write this. Yes, I am terrible at understanding what people are saying between the lines. Not only that, but I am also terrible at keeping a small talk flowing. I have tried to tackle this by asking questions about the other person frequently through a convo. But to separate an interrogation from a playful conversation from the get-go, I haven't found a way yet. Usually, I break this barrier after I get to know the other person a little bit first (But as you understand, I almost never get there). And I got no leadership traits at all.",

Yeah that's my life.\n-Why did you graduate a 5-year uni course at 25? \nWhat i say: Well I had some financial issues I had to take care of myself. I was working and studying and it was too much to handle so i left uni a bit behind.\nWhat i dont say: I suffer from chronic depression ever since i was a teenager. In my undergrad years it got so bad i almost killed myself numerous times. I got so anxious going back to uni at 24 for my senor year i was getting mild panic attacks.\n-Why dont you talk more around us? \nWhat i say: Well I dont like talking while having my lunch.\nWhat i dont say: I spent 7 years in isolation and I have zero social skills and I have nothing to contribute in a conversation.",
