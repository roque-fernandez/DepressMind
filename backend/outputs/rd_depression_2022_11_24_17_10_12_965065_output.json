    "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

I realized I\u2019m just existing and waiting to be ended naturally. But I\u2019m fortunate for the life. In my days off I like alone in my own little life just simple no arguing no crazy creepy people staring, no gossiping, no emotionally bullshit I have to deal with. At work I spent each days with these fucks 13 hours a day dealing with the fucking obsessions of gossiping. I\u2019m so fucking tired.",

It's been so hard dealing with my injuries and not being able to do all the things I used to. I'm pretty much on lock down here and have several limitations to what I can do. I haven't been home or off base in three years and now all of a sudden in less than two months they are going to throw me back into society. I have severe social anxiety and depression. I don't know if I can handle the real world. The people I'm surrounded with are absolute idiots who take nothing seriously. If I ask for help I get told \"suck it up it's not that bad\" or \"I've seen a guy get blown up you don't know what depression is\" it's frustrating. I feel so alone even though I'm surrounded by people. I just sit in a closet to cope bc it's the quietest place. I want someone to be with me but there's no one.",
