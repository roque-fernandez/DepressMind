There\u2019s so much I want to say about it all. But here are my impressions \u2026 Overall: Damn I love your country and your people. There is such a theme of environmentalism and conscientiousness. I felt so safe (I\u2019m from the US). With tongue in cheek we chuckled that a convenience store holdup with a kitchen knife made the national news. I envy that. I also learned quickly that once you\u2019re out of the towns, don\u2019t count on quick amenities, lol. Also, so many hot construction workers\u2026Jesus. \nMelbourne: everyone wears black puffy coats, lol. I loved your European narrow alleys of delicious food and your diversity. Your museum and zoo \ud83d\ude0d. Your mass transit is a bit confusing at first, but we were grateful for it. I couldn\u2019t understand how you are so close to such a beautiful coast but I didn\u2019t see that reflected within your city/port. \nSt Kilda: you\u2019re adorable. I\u2019d love to spend a weekend with you. \nMornington peninsula: You\u2019re as beautiful as people said. I\u2019m sorry to have been there on a Monday and missed your eateries. Your coastal towns are lovely \u2026 I can see how the encroachment of big money is changing things because there are still quaint Oceanside holdouts (good for you). I absolutely LOVED the ferry. That is a well maintained vessel! \nGreat Ocean Road: Jesus. You are what life is about. \nWarrnalbool: You taught us how to actually speak Australian. \u201cWe talk lazy.\u201d (that hits home, being from the south). You were cute, friendly, and damn those hot springs are next level. \nMount Gambier: You\u2019re an interesting creature. It felt like you\u2019re trying to be something you\u2019re not, and I don\u2019t mean that in a shitty way. You felt like a town of people who grind and are salt of the earth, but the town around them is trying to be fancy? There are fascinating and charming historical buildings, but inside they\u2019re full of glaring lights and modernities that seem to strip the soul of the building they\u2019re in. I\u2019ll also never forget that kids face, about 8 y/o, who was on a tablet at the bar for about 5 hours (when we left to get hotel and came back from dinner)\nAdelaide: Your market is nirvana. I would move there for the market alone. \nPort Lincoln: You felt like the sea more than any other town. I loved your understated beauty, and your kindness. You, and the experiences you provided, will always remain a myriad of reality and fantasy in my mind.\nSydney: The rocks is a charming area \u2026 the buildings are beautiful. I loved your sky. \nTldr: traveled from Melbourne along the Great Ocean Road to Port Lincoln and will never forget the beauty and kindness of your country.\nEdit: some things I forgot! \nBeachport, your beach is a  breathtaking volcanic wonder\u2026you even have a water pool in the shape of Australia! \nPerth people we hung out with: I asked, \u201cWhat do Australians take pride in? The response: Taking the piss out of each other.\u201d This cracked me up \nGOR Wildlife park: Dear Dingo Advocate and Wildlife Park owner, I never imagined getting to see so many wallabies with their joeys hanging halfway outside their pouch, and even eating out of my hand! Your place was beautiful and set the tone for an awesome adventure day. Your passion for dingos was so charming \nGlamping near 12 apostles: We were convinced we were going to be murdered in the middle of the night. It was terrifying and awesome, thank you for the pre-Halloween excitement \nTo the lady who works at or owns the motel restaurant just outside Pebble Point \u2026.we we really caught off guard that there wasn\u2019t a grocery store of some sort for so long, and we stumbled upon your humble establishment in fairly dire need of provisions \u2026.you made us some of the best food we had eaten in country, AND had booze we could buy for the night! You were a godsend and we loved it. \nI want to keep going, but I should probably stop. I\u2019m glad some of what I\u2019ve shared hits home for so many. \ud83d\udc93",

    "text": "My husband and I visited Australia for the first time in our lives. We had three weeks and spent it between Melbourne and Port Lincoln, with a brief 2-night stay in Sydney. There\u2019s so much I want to say about it all. But here are my impressions \u2026 Overall: Damn I love your country and your people. There is such a theme of environmentalism and conscientiousness. I felt so safe (I\u2019m from the US). With tongue in cheek we chuckled that a convenience store holdup with a kitchen knife made the national news. I envy that. I also learned quickly that once you\u2019re out of the towns, don\u2019t count on quick amenities, lol. Also, so many hot construction workers\u2026Jesus. \nMelbourne: everyone wears black puffy coats, lol. I loved your European narrow alleys of delicious food and your diversity. Your museum and zoo \ud83d\ude0d. Your mass transit is a bit confusing at first, but we were grateful for it. I couldn\u2019t understand how you are so close to such a beautiful coast but I didn\u2019t see that reflected within your city/port. \nSt Kilda: you\u2019re adorable. I\u2019d love to spend a weekend with you. \nMornington peninsula: You\u2019re as beautiful as people said. I\u2019m sorry to have been there on a Monday and missed your eateries. Your coastal towns are lovely \u2026 I can see how the encroachment of big money is changing things because there are still quaint Oceanside holdouts (good for you). I absolutely LOVED the ferry. That is a well maintained vessel! \nGreat Ocean Road: Jesus. You are what life is about. \nWarrnalbool: You taught us how to actually speak Australian. \u201cWe talk lazy.\u201d (that hits home, being from the south). You were cute, friendly, and damn those hot springs are next level. \nMount Gambier: You\u2019re an interesting creature. It felt like you\u2019re trying to be something you\u2019re not, and I don\u2019t mean that in a shitty way. You felt like a town of people who grind and are salt of the earth, but the town around them is trying to be fancy? There are fascinating and charming historical buildings, but inside they\u2019re full of glaring lights and modernities that seem to strip the soul of the building they\u2019re in. I\u2019ll also never forget that kids face, about 8 y/o, who was on a tablet at the bar for about 5 hours (when we left to get hotel and came back from dinner)\nAdelaide: Your market is nirvana. I would move there for the market alone. \nPort Lincoln: You felt like the sea more than any other town. I loved your understated beauty, and your kindness. You, and the experiences you provided, will always remain a myriad of reality and fantasy in my mind.\nSydney: The rocks is a charming area \u2026 the buildings are beautiful. I loved your sky. \nTldr: traveled from Melbourne along the Great Ocean Road to Port Lincoln and will never forget the beauty and kindness of your country.\nEdit: some things I forgot! \nBeachport, your beach is a  breathtaking volcanic wonder\u2026you even have a water pool in the shape of Australia! \nPerth people we hung out with: I asked, \u201cWhat do Australians take pride in? The response: Taking the piss out of each other.\u201d This cracked me up \nGOR Wildlife park: Dear Dingo Advocate and Wildlife Park owner, I never imagined getting to see so many wallabies with their joeys hanging halfway outside their pouch, and even eating out of my hand! Your place was beautiful and set the tone for an awesome adventure day. Your passion for dingos was so charming \nGlamping near 12 apostles: We were convinced we were going to be murdered in the middle of the night. It was terrifying and awesome, thank you for the pre-Halloween excitement \nTo the lady who works at or owns the motel restaurant just outside Pebble Point \u2026.we we really caught off guard that there wasn\u2019t a grocery store of some sort for so long, and we stumbled upon your humble establishment in fairly dire need of provisions \u2026.you made us some of the best food we had eaten in country, AND had booze we could buy for the night! You were a godsend and we loved it. \nI want to keep going, but I should probably stop. I\u2019m glad some of what I\u2019ve shared hits home for so many. \ud83d\udc93",
