 "text": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to go, but therapy has never really helped me with this problem and I can't bring it up to my mom or grandparents because I'm tired of the endless cycle of me justifiably bringing up an issue and them starting a fight. There's a thousand and one reasons I have depression relating to every poor way my parents \"parented\" me growing up from the neglect of my dad and blatant abuse of my mom and grandfather. But the thing that drove me up a fucking wall today was, my grandmom retired recently and she can't find anything to keep her busy so she just keeps fixing random crap around our house that doesn't need fixing, and bugging the rest of us. I suggested she journal, read, or write a story, she thought it was a good idea, so I went down into our basement guest room where I have a lot of my things stored from college still, to find her a book. And it was re-arranged when my grandparents retired so my grandfather could work on his coin collection. I walk into the room and see my stuff re-arranged. Oh well, as long as it's there neat I'm cool with it. Then I turn around and see the 5 journals I kept through the 3 years of college I had, lined up next to a bunch of old school work and art work my uncle made when he was a kid that my grandmom and mom have been reading and laughing over. So I have this irking and explosive rage building up in me right now that's there because I feel it's pretty obvious that my mom and grandmom have been reading my private shit. It's making me want to explode and yell at them all right now, but I know they'll just try and gas light me and spin on me that I'm the bad guy. I know the easy answer is \"its their house, they can do what they want, move out\", and I've heard it before. But I am trying to move out, it's difficult, and even if I am living here, I bought those journals, and I wrote them when I was living at school, that doesn't give them the right to invade my privacy. And if I haven't mentioned this already the reason I'm so paranoid is because my mom has read my journal without my consent before, during covid, when I was at a really low place with depression working my ass off to pass online physics and chemistry classes that are impossible enough in person and I was going crazy studying extra hours online to pass. And she took everything I wrote out of context, and even though she was barely even mentioned in my journal entries, she decided to take the whole thing personally and cause more problems for me by calling me selfish and starting more fights. I think she's bipolar or borderline personality, because I flipped out at her to never do that again or I'd leave the house and stop talking to her, and she did it again after a few weeks, so I started leaving threats in my journal to hurt her, knowing she'd disobey the one thing I ask of her, hoping she'd stop, but she just started more shit, and then suddenly started leaving weird fake sentimental notes in my journals and always found them no matter where I hid them, as if that would somehow absolve her of the fact she's invading my privacy, insincere apology written in a book your forbidden to write in or not, that's still going against the one thing I ask her not to do, so I followed through and I left mid-way through covid and lived with my dad until move in day the following semester at college, barely speaking to my mom. Then I move back in with her after college and a year goes by, nothing bad except a few arguments, and now we're here, where I see all of my journals removed from where I put them, all neatly stacked in ORDER BY YEAR, making me believe she STILL went against my wishes and read my shit. \nWhat can I do about this until I can move out? I don't want to bring this up to her or my grandparents because I don't want to deal with my mom starting shit and making me feel bad for being born at the moment. And I'm not on good terms with my dad either (long story short he ran off and started a new family with an abusive woman who treated me and my sister like garbage) so I can't just simply up and move there. This is just the tip of the ice berg on how my family has treated me, there is much worse out there that they've done in my life but this is the most recent thing. And I feel really bad saying this but, I've never been a violent person, I've never wanted to hurt anyone nor have I ever attempted to without reasonable cause (self-defense), but I catch myself wishing my family would just all up and die some days, like since I can't get out yet it feels like the only relief I'll get is them all just permanently shutting up. When I finally get to move out I'm just going to cut her off as well as my grandparents and maybe my dad (I say maybe because I still have young half siblings living with him that I would like to be able to know), but for now the only feelings I have for them is dread and the horrifying desire for them to just stop existing. I don't know how to handle this anger, I just know that it's going to eat away at me until something bad happens, like an early life heart attack or something, my blood pressure is already high for my age and it's only gotten higher because of the stress and anger my family causes, I don't know what to do.",

Since I have horrible mental health, it was a real struggle to get through - there were so many sleepless nights, breakdowns and I pushed myself to my absolute limit on many occasions. So reaching the end should be a pretty big victory.\nWhen I started uni, I was basically a recluse who didn't know how to talk to people and had zero social life. However, through a combination of therapy, medication and just how easy uni makes it to socialise, I managed to really come out of my shell. I became the president of a campus social club. Went on a lot of dates. Made some friends. Worked on some really interesting projects. Hell, I even started dressing well. I've been told I'm practically unrecognizable compared to the way I was when I started. It's a real success story. University doesn't necessarily make anything easier, but it makes the opportunities to improve more accessible - want to make friends? Here's a specific event you can go to this week filled with people that have similar interests. It sets you up for success, if you can push yourself to go for it.\nSo after saying all that, you may be wondering what I'm doing here. The problem is, I feel like the only part of my life that's ever mattered is over. These past years have been so eventful and vibrant, and I'm only just realising that now that it's ending. Sort of like how you don't realise when the good old days are until they're over.  What am I even supposed to do with myself now? Nothing will ever be as exciting, and all the social opportunities I enjoyed are going to be much fewer and far between. It might seem silly to be sad about literally achieving my goals, but the university lifestyle is just so dynamic and interesting and I don't want it to end.\nA few people know that I've been struggling with this, but I don't think anybody realises the full extent.  I feel like I've been wearing a mask. A few months from now when I step up onto that stage and accept my degree, it feels like my life will be over.  Like if I ended things right there, that would be fine and I would have ended up a high note. For a while I didn't even want to end things anymore, but now I'm starting to feel that way again.\nI feel worse than I have in ages and it's because I turned myself around and am close to achieving something I've been working towards for a long time. Sounds silly when I say it out loud. But it's how I'm feeling right now.",

I know I have had it happen more than twice because I have felt the same symptoms multiple times on other occasions, but I am to scared to do anything.

This time  I said I said I will wait till next time and get the operation then. I am still scared though, but I also want it to be over so badly. One of the reasons I said no this time is because for a while now I haven't felt great, which stupid enough I am also too scared to say to anyone.

 "text": "Sorry in advance for the wall of text, but I can see where you are and I believe my experience will be helpful to you\nThe first, and hardest, step to becoming better is to recognise that you have a problem - which you have done. The thought \"There's probably nothing actually wrong with me\" is the depression speaking. Know that you are self aware enough to see the problem, intelligent enough to know you can't fix everything yourself, and strong enough to seek help. No matter what else the depression has taken from you I can see these 3 things, and more, from your comment alone.\nThe thing about our mind is that absolutely every thing we experience, from hearing a sound to seeing light to watching an action unfold, and everything in between, is simply an interpretation of what's going on around us. The first and most important thing you always have to keep in mind is that YOU ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS. You are the filter that screens and sorts them; your are the junction between \"thought\", \"Memory\", and \"physical action\". You are the observer within your body, whom takes the information available to them and moves their body accordingly. What this means is that what you feel is not you either. You experience the emotion, yes, but it eventually passes. Even if it takes days or weeks for any relief, it will eventually pass. \nThat was a little wordy but what I'm getting at is that what you feel and think are not trivial. Every sensation that passes through your mind is significant and important, because you ARE experiencing it - the feeling or thought never would have occured in the first place if you weren't. \nThe next big point that I want to make is that the people in your life want to hear about these things from you. Maybe not everyone, and definitely not all the time (because even if time has stopped for us we still need to remember that time still moves for everyone else), but I 100% guarantee that you have someone in your life that is willing to hear about what's on your mind.\nI won't be able to say much more without straying into advice territory, so this is what I did to pull myself out of my head:\nA) I accepted that something was wrong and that there were professionals who not only knew more than me, but knew better. \nB) I accepted that I didn't have to control absolutely every aspect of my life in order to feel safe. Isolation and irritability cleaved a lot from my life, and that's okay.\nC) I accepted that getting anywhere in life takes a long time, often 3 or 4 times what I would initially expect. It's unreasonable to expect yourself to be instantly successful or good at what you do; allow yourself the time to make the early general mistakes before you zero in on the details\nD) I found ways to get advice about my problems without directly bringing them up; this was only really helpful to get me started, though. Being clear and concise of what you experience will allow others to help you much more.\nE) I got medicated\nF) I went to therapy\nEvery step is an insurmountable cliff with winds threatening to blow you off at any moment - but I know that with your dedication to becoming a better person that you will be able to do it.\nLet me know if you need anything clarified or expanded on, it's a little all over the place",

Consequences are of no consequences. My mind is not racing with thoughts. Living in the moment at its finest. Perhaps it is exhausted. I am, too, you know?",

I thought I could just brute force my way through every day life like I did in high school, but now in uni I feel just numb. It\u2019s gotten so hard to wake up in the morning and go to bed at night. Sometimes I think I should just go back to not sleeping and let my subconscious push me through. I\u2019m tired. My everything is getting worse, I feel like a burden no matter what. I can\u2019t put together a portfolio nor cv so I cant coerce myself into finding a job, even though I should \nNowadays all I can think of\u2014 when I\u2019m not overloading my brain with music/movies and books/art\u2014 is that im a worthless parasite that should just hurry up and die",

Like without doing anything bad, feeling or being down is like a way for them to judge your character. \"Well, it's your fault you feel that way...\" Like thanks? Not like I was trying to place blame on people for my problems anyway, or it's not like I wasn't already blaming myself. I definitely needed the reassurance that everything wrong with me is my fault and I feel so much better now. /s",
