I am physically and mentally fatigued from dealing with this \"end of the world everything's bad\" feeling burning in me nonstop. It's like a radio playing somewhere but I can't find it and turn it off.",

 "text": "With depression, I feel like people do not know how to respond. All I want is someone to understand. People always think you want them to fix you, like swoop right in and take care of you and make all of your problems disappear. No, that is not what I want. And no, that is not what I'm asking for. I just want an understanding. The only person who can fix my problems is myself and possibly a therapist and/or medications. I feel like that is why people get so upset about the topic of depression. They think you want them to fix you. It's not about fixing someone. Is it really too much to ask for some empathy?",

Yea I want to die. I don't have anything to look foward it.",
