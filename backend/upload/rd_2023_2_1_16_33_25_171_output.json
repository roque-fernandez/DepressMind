 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

She expressed anger that it was \"quirky\" and how dare I wear something colourful that makes me happy. She was well dressed wearing blundstones.

Some days worse than others. I work, but only half time. Even then I spend so much energy trying to counter the depression that my work is not what it used to be. I\u2019m getting by but just barely. A fee weeks ago, I knew it was worsening. I\u2019ve worked with my doctor to adjust my medication. I\u2019m about a week into that. \nI\u2019ve been through four rounds of CBT, as well as talk therapy, counseling, etc. \nI\u2019ve just been told that my contract will end at the end of the month.

 "text": "Lately I've been feeling more alone and isolated than I have in a long time.  I get out and go to social activities and talk to people, but there's this feeling I can't shake, I feel like nobody really cares to be around me and that I'm kind of just a background character.  Like maybe people might enjoy talking to me at the weekly events I go to, but nobody really wants to get to know me or be around me beyond that.  I can put myself out there, but I'm struggling to turn that into real genuine connections.\nIt's something I've always dealt with, but it's also gotten worse in the last year or so.  A while ago I had developed a fairly close friendship with someone who ended up blaming me for their breakup (it ended for reasons entirely unrelated to me) and they said some really awful things.  I didn't really realise this until relatively recently, but that event honestly kind of broke me - I'm sort of realising that in the last year in particular I've felt a lot of cynicism and paranoia towards forming new connections and I think a lot of it stems from that event.  Even if I get past the persistent feeling that someone don't like me, I still feel disposable, like they'll just drop me as a friend and stop talking to me for some reason, or blame me for something.  I've had this happen to me a few times and it's always felt awful but I think the event I mentioned was a bit of a turning point for me because it was someone I thought I had a particularly genuine friendship with.  It's such a rare thing to find, but it can end so easily and in ways you can't even control or predict.  It's so crushing.\nAnyways, there's my midnight rant.  I just feel so completely alone in life and every day feels harder than the last.",

I am physically and mentally fatigued from dealing with this \"end of the world everything's bad\" feeling burning in me nonstop. It's like a radio playing somewhere but I can't find it and turn it off.",

I seriously don't get the point.  \nI just want my own space where I won't be looked at, won't be belittled, won't be sad.  I'm so tired all the time.  I'm so miserable all the time.
