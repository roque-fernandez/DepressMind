 "text": "I've had depression my entire life. I've just turned 33, and things have never improved. I really don't know what to do anymore, what else to try, who to turn to.\nI've had 20+ therapists, tried 10+ different kinds of medication, and I've even done TMS and ketamine. I exercise, eat healthy, don't drink, don't watch porn, don't play video games, don't use social media, or watch TV. I've tried moving states, cities, and jobs. I've never had any friends, never had a gf. Even when I try, I never meet anyone. Nothing helps even a little.\nI'm beginning to think that my life will always be this way, since it has always been this way. I'm beginning to really believe suicide is my only remaining option to free me from this pain. The national hotline is completely garbage. I've even put myself in the hospital once before, because I thought surely I'd receive help. No, I was treated like a prisoner, and received no help.\nI really just don't know where to turn or what else to do.",

Isn\u2019t this type of music supposed to help you reconstruct the memory associating with certain places? It feels kinda alienating because I don\u2019t find the lyrics resonating at all, the majority of them. A weird spot to be in, emotionally. The goal is, perhaps, not to try to pinpoint and label exactly what feelings I\u2019m going through at the moment. Goals? Just stop being ridiculous and being as humanely productive as possible. Being vaguely intimate with the way things are enough. \nLet it be, before you get caught up in the unceasing rhythm of life again.",

 "text": "24 here.\nI guess the hardest thing about this is wanting to get better means wanting to live, and I know it sounds pathetic but I don't. I never have. Now I've graduated, with a degree that's not useless but practically robbed me of my one release, trying to figure shit out but sabotaging myself at every turn. Didn't help that I turned to addiction (alcohol, weed) the past years because my bi-polar was already fucking insane (not that those helped, it was just a placebo) and the unresolved trauma I have both from growing up and from life after (I was in a drive-by on the other side of a window not too long ago, friend of a friend I used to smoke with was gunned down (which even though I only know him from smoking on occasion for some reason fucks me up, feels like I shouldn't feel this way because I didn't know him that well)). \nI don't know how it feels to want to live. I lied about it to get out of the psych ward years ago, and have learned better than to talk about it for fear of being forced to go back. Hence the escapism, that like you manifested in being raised by TV\u2122 because of zero emotional support (I tried to kill myself in middle school, I tried asking for help and was greeted with an hour long yell session while being told to suck it up; naturally there's been attempts since, I guess I'm lucky I'm still here? I wish I could just transfer my years to someone who actually wanted to, very few people actually know and I was essentially in a coma after od'ing on Xanax and whiskey for a whole weekend, woke up to nothing, shit the only way they'd know if it was successful is after my body would start to rot and the smells going everywhere causing someone in the building to notice).\nSo here I am. Technically recovering from carpal tunnel surgery that I let progress and fuck me up for too long. I know that I can't kill myself, and I guess that's fine, but it means I need to find some attachment and I for the love it can't. Guess I'll figure it out eventually, feels like it's already too late.\nI really don't want to be here. I really just don't want to be here.",

 "text": "Also 24. Same experience minus the addiction/drugs. Also graduated with a good degree in IT with a fairly good road-map of how to make a great living within 5 years... does not help with anything. At all. I feel like I didn't do it for me but because everyone said I should. No emotional support. My 5th grade teacher expressed far more concern and care after learning I was suicidal than my parents. I also got scolded for that, and then scolded again when my 6th grade counselor called my parents up about me mentioning them arguing all of the time.\nI really guess you really just find a way to keep going. I can't say I have that much will to live in a way that would be feasible. After all I went through to graduate and try to start my career, I would throw it all away to feel like someone cared about me beyond basic needs and to figure out what I genuinely want which is not to work for 40 years no matter how much I might make.",
