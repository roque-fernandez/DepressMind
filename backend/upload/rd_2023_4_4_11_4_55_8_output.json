 "text": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\nPeople breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\nRole modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\nContent that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\nOff-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

I get angry, I get sad, I get hurt, I'm allowed to feel those things without \"getting in trouble.\"  I'm tired of being the bitchboy in the family because I'm the youngest, being looked down upon because well, she's amenable, she'll do it when it's convenient.  Well, yeah, I can, but it doesn't mean it doesn't affect me.\nI'm not a monster.

Started getting episodes of severe pain on top of that oct/nov last year which has been ongoing. I just had very painful surgery recently to fix the problem but its not a normal surgical recovery in that I will continue to have episodes of severe pain & it will worsen before it improves & recovery will take likely months rather than weeks. Had a very severe pain episode a week ago and it was worst since surgery which was about a month ago.\nIt seems to have triggered depression and I can't stop thinking about all the negative things that have happened to me and regrets and how I fucked up my life at various points and feel terrible.",

 "text": "It feels like I'm trapped in a rut that I can never escape from. I have severe depression, little connection with any of my friends, take terrible care of my hygiene, and I hate my parents. My parents constantly gaslight me and are terrible human beings who constantly voice out their horrific beliefs that they don't know are basically targeted at me. I feel so much hatred every time I pretend to love them, pretend that I'm happy being near them, pretend I'm happy as they constantly attempt to take the only time that gives me a sliver of what I consider \"happiness\" to be. I constantly sit there and listen as they say that something is wrong with me, or as my mom says she'll force me to a therapist if I don't talk or communicate with a random stranger I've never known. I constantly hate myself and feel like a fake, believing that I'm faking my emotions to get a reaction or attention from others. I feel disgusted every day that I don't brush my teeth or shower, and I feel like a freak every time I hear people talk about how disgusting that behavior is. I feel like a fake when I hear all those posts talk about how it's the people who're happy on the outside that suffer the most. I feel invalidated and feel that nobody will ever take my feelings seriously just because I'm not like that stereotype. Of course, most people around me won't even realize something is wrong unless you clearly say you have depression, and everybody jokes about it, so why would anybody care about me who is OBVIOUSLY just going along with it. I feel like I've spent my entire life researching ways to get better, from why someone might have depression and into the pros and cons of antidepressants. I really don't understand myself. I don't even feel like a human being anymore. How could I possibly be a normal human in a world where people are so focused on goals and happiness and the future? How is everybody planning on a stage of life that I don't even plan on making it to? How is my entire life spent on attempts to understand what's wrong with me while they're all worried about what college they want to go to? I feel even worse knowing that plenty of people in this sub have probably felt this exact way, yet are still alive, with it only being their first step into hell. I've really gone through nothing bad, yet I still sit here and complain about my life, acting like I'm a victim who's actually gone through something.",

It's really freaking discouraging. It's always scary meeting a new therapist, so I am kinda dreading whenever one is available. But I also feel very alone and scared so I want it to happen sooner rather than later.\nEverything seems so difficult for some reason and I feel ashamed for it. I'm too depressed to take care of myself most days. I've lost a lot of weight from not eating enough because I'm too depressed to tackle the ordeal of cooking. It's hard to remember to brush my teeth, I probably have cavities. I feel like a worthless lump. The world is hostile and I don't feel like I fit in it anywhere. I'm lost.\nI have constant anxiety weighing down on me. It's crushing. So much fear and dread. It's affecting my physical health. I am seeing doctors about the physical stuff, at least. But if the root cause is all the depression and anxiety and other stuff i was diagnosed with, it feels like just a bandaid seeing doctors for the physical symptoms. It feels a little like a waste of effort.\nI would feel totally alone if i didn't have my cat. She helps ground me, and if nothing else I can get the will to get up and take care of her. I'm so glad she's here. She keeps me here. She makes me happy. She's the best thing in the world. I want to get better and give her a good long life.\nI'm doing my best to hang in there. I'll keep trying. But it hurts and I hope it stops hurting.",

But from the looks of things, you seem to have some form of stability, or at least a roof over your head to lay around under, so it's not the end of the world! (Yet).\nYou are down on your luck, It's difficult to get up and face the world, but no one said you had to conquer it in a single day, what you need to do now is take little steps. Stop punishing yourself for not working out. If you really want to do some exercise, put the phone down and do 5 pushups right now. That was really quick, right? Doing 5 more next time you randomly decide to do 5 pushups will be a minute of your time at most.\nI have no idea what your job was or what level in your career you're at, but you can take little steps to improve that, too! Werther, it's a portfolio, a CV that needs polishing up, work on that little by little, make phone calls, and send in those applications. Try to think of contacts you may have who could know of an open job for you.\nLife gets hard on us sometimes. The last thing you need is to be so hard on yourself!",

People look down on me but I'm good enough when you need someone to help you move or do something that benefits you.\nIf I hear one more god damn time that my sister went out to lunch with someone else I'm going to scream.  We were supposed to go out 3+ years ago, supposedly that was \"my Christmas present,\" then for my last birthday \"we were supposed to go out to spend time together,\" then recently it was \"after the 18th.\"\nNothing.  Dude, if you don't care about me, don't fucking tell me you want to go out.  It would hurt less than you fucking lying and forgetting about me.  I swear to god, I'm never getting fucking married and losing myself to a man that doesn't give a shit about me.  A guy that fucking puts an anchor around my neck and their family is more important than my fucking family.  God fucking damn fucking people, I swear to Christ.  I don't trust love so much it fucking hurts my soul.  I have yet to see real fucking love. REAL LOVE, where the fuck are you?\nMy sister has been taken away from me.  My friend has been taken away from me.  I'm so god damn tired of people's significant others being all high and mighty and everyone else falling on the god damn sword.  I'm tired of falling on the god damn sword.  I'm worth more than this.\nSome nights I just want to be held so fucking bad.  I want someone to hold me and it be real intimacy.  Not a joke, not some \"in\" to fuck, something real.  I don't believe in it.  I don't see it.  Fuck it.\nI just... here is safe.  Here alone in my room away from everyone is safe.  Why the fuck do I have to pick up the pieces all the god damn time?  Everything is such a fucking mess.",

 "text": "I just have this profound pulling at me like I\u2019m not supposed to be here. My life is empty of all happiness. I don\u2019t have anyone anymore. Most of my friends have passed and I just feel like I should be wherever that is instead of here. I don\u2019t really care for myself that much and there\u2019s no one I can talk to. I have a career where I am supposed to be highly competent and reliable, but I can\u2019t muster the energy to take basic care of myself. I just want to drift away from here. I\u2019ve never done well on my own and I don\u2019t think I can put up with the constant thoughts and heartache all the time. Everyone needs someone. Everyone needs a reason. I\u2019ve been looking for 21 years and found nothing but people who try to take advantage or put themselves in a position to use me for money. I\u2019m no fool, and I have tried so hard to break this pattern and search for a family. There just isn\u2019t any opportunity for one anymore and I\u2019m getting to the age that it might not matter. I\u2019m very stubborn and haven\u2019t given up on anything in my life. So I find it ironic the one thing I desperately want to give up is life itself. I just don\u2019t want to be alone with these thoughts anymore. It wasn\u2019t always this way I\u2019ve been trying to find my way back but the only way I seem to go is down. I only hope no one else feels this way. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t last this long for them. Half my life I\u2019ve fought this fight and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to much longer.",

 "text": "Hello. I'm doing ok. I've been trying to keep myself busy with lifting, guitar, video games, work. It's been a struggle. But I'm doing ok. The first month of the breakup was rough but we still lived together and it felt almost the same. But now that she has moved out, I feel like I'm going through the breakup pains again. She moved out a few weeks ago now. It's better now. But it's still a struggle.\nThe biggest depressive moment I had lately was my job promotion. On the surface it's great. I feel like it was a recognition and well deserved reward for several years of hard work. But on the other hand, when I got off the meeting, and looked around at the apartment, I realized I was alone. I had no one to celebrate it with.\nIt was the deepest feeling of depression I've had in a long while. I've done some things to make myself feel like I celebrated. I went out to a caf\u00e9 the next day and treated myself to a nice lunch. And just sat there admiring the world from another place. And it was nice. But the lonely feeling was still there.\nI realize now that this lonely feeling is something I'm going to have to get used to. It's a feeling like I'm drifting through an empty void. Just bouncing off friends and family with no real comfort or attachments.\nBut it'll be ok. It always has, and I'm sure it will be.",

 "text": "Normally sleep would help. To wake up with existential dread is not the best way to start a day. I can feel the heaviness on my chest and in my stomach. \nAm I in fear? Totally. Is there anything you can do to prevent the statistically highly possible? I don\u2019t know how am I supposed to know? I\u2019m not sure anger would help here either. The person who\u2019s filled with rage is the first to get burned (in hell.) \nWhat can I say? That it\u2019s normal for your grieving process to vacillate among different emotional states. Not giving your feelings too much weight lest they would cloud your judgment aside, feelings are there first and foremost to tell you something. The child might be having unreasonable fear by the standard of an an adult, or it could be an actual valid concern of theirs. At any rate, would you forcefully tell the worried child to fuck off instead of assuring them that they are heard, working together for a solution and teaching them/reinforcing healthy coping mechanisms? I hope the answer is clear.\nStill, I refuse to label the unknown future. Keep doing what I can and resign to fate when it comes to it. Be steadfast in my practice. At least in the letting-go-of-myself department. It\u2019s a relief because even if this moment were my last, I wouldn\u2019t have any regret. No regret of what I should have done, what I should not have done, what I wanted to do, what I should do. Isn\u2019t it funny and insightful that in this thought experiment you don\u2019t regret you didn\u2019t have more? Stuff, experience, people, yourself. Gone with the wind. God it feels like I\u2019m writing final words for myself sometimes. I just have faith that no matter where the wheel of fortune stops, my future self will be able to handle it gracefully.",
