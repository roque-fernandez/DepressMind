 "text": "Lately I've been feeling more alone and isolated than I have in a long time.  I get out and go to social activities and talk to people, but there's this feeling I can't shake, I feel like nobody really cares to be around me and that I'm kind of just a background character.  Like maybe people might enjoy talking to me at the weekly events I go to, but nobody really wants to get to know me or be around me beyond that.  I can put myself out there, but I'm struggling to turn that into real genuine connections.\nIt's something I've always dealt with, but it's also gotten worse in the last year or so.  A while ago I had developed a fairly close friendship with someone who ended up blaming me for their breakup (it ended for reasons entirely unrelated to me) and they said some really awful things.  I didn't really realise this until relatively recently, but that event honestly kind of broke me - I'm sort of realising that in the last year in particular I've felt a lot of cynicism and paranoia towards forming new connections and I think a lot of it stems from that event.  Even if I get past the persistent feeling that someone don't like me, I still feel disposable, like they'll just drop me as a friend and stop talking to me for some reason, or blame me for something.  I've had this happen to me a few times and it's always felt awful but I think the event I mentioned was a bit of a turning point for me because it was someone I thought I had a particularly genuine friendship with.  It's such a rare thing to find, but it can end so easily and in ways you can't even control or predict.  It's so crushing.\nAnyways, there's my midnight rant.  I just feel so completely alone in life and every day feels harder than the last.",
